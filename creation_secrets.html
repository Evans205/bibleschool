                        <h4>Preface</h4>
                        <p> This is a teaching by The Lord Jesus on how to understand:</p>
                           <ol type ="1">
                            <li>  The reason and manner of creation.</li>
                            <li>  The nature of God as a consuming fire.</li>
                            <li>  The way of the work of the Lord Jesus in and for us.</li>
                             <li> The eternal will of God in all His creation.</li>
                            <li>  The current work of the Lord Jesus in the Church.</li>
                            <li>  The preparation for the rapture.</li>
                            <li>  The alignment of the Old Testament and the New Testament plan.</li>
                        </ol>
                            
                           <h3>Listen and Understand</h3>
                           <p> Discover the thought that I had when nothing was created.</p>
                           <p> It is to be understood by some level of spiritual maturity.</p>
                            
                           <h3>God’s Representation</h3>
                           <p> Son, before the creation I chose myself missile of flame of fire that you see as my representation.</p>
                           <p> I was floating and moving along the emptiness since eternity.</p>
                           <p> Before anything was created, My energy was so affluent and abundant that even the infinite space was suffering the weight of my presence that was prevailing in the emptiness.</p>
                           <p> That is why it is written, in the beginning was the Word, but do you think that the infinite emptiness was vacant.</p>
                            <p>was supposed to move in order to fill the emptiness and the infinite space with my energy and presence in order to allocate myself an infinite territory and affirm my omnipresence.</p>
                            <p>But then, an undulation springing from my breathe began to take over the firmament in order to fill this infinite empty space with my energy.</p>
                            <p>This may be beyond your understanding, but you can at least imagine my capacity to fill the infinite emptiness which I was supposed to fill with my presence.</p>
                            <p>This is how the firmament was seized and filled with my presence, it was after filling the emptiness of the firmament with my presence that I said, “let there be light”.</p>
                            <p>I did not necessarily need a luminous source because this energy was already available in order to produce high voltage electricity.</p>
                            <p>In fact, sparkling and glittering vibration were colliding and ramming themselves in order to produce flashing of light and thunderbolt as a result of electrical charge and shock that emptiness could not bear. As a result, metallic sounds were reverberating and repeating themselves continuously because of the intensity of the electricity.</p>
                           <p> I had to equilibrate these reverberations in intervening as Jehovah Shalom, it is at that moment that thoughts began to renew in my spirit. I was saying in myself if only a universe could exist so that they could be seized by these energies, if only heaven could be in order to be affected by these energies, if only nature could appear in order to be seized by these energies,</p>
                           <p> I said in me it is time to create so that my electrical energy can be incarnated in my work.</p>
                           <p> Be careful, all of the works of my creation are energetic, they incarnate energetic potentiality, that is why in the pass of my appearance in the Bible was in the fiery flame up to Pentecost and in every manifestation of fire I was incorporating my energy into people.</p>
                            <p>If there is an orbit or ring of fire above your head it is to indicate to you that you are full of my energy that is producing electricity in you, that is why I told you when I was in the flesh you are the light of the world.</p>
                           <p> In the time of creation, I wanted to suspend everything in space, no need of support. This is in order to teach the world that my creation is unshakable because of my energies that support it.</p>
                           <p> God really want man to know the Energetic Foundation</p>
                           <p> Understand, oh son of man that everything that was created whether visible of invisible have an energetic foundation.</p>
                            
                            <h3>The Law of Execution</h3>
                           <p>Around me the law of execution is at work, the moment I think, immediately it comes to pass.</p>
                            <p>Every object of my thought initiates the process of creation thanks to these energies. When I think about something, a black and white design of the object appear in my vision waiting for my word in order to become colour and animated.</p>
                           <p>My word coloured and animated my outline and sketch as it is written, ‘My For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.<p>
                           <p>9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p>
                            <p>10 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:</p>
                           <p> 11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.</p>
                            
                            <h3> imposed law of God’s will in all creation</h3>
                            <p>The visible and invisible were before my face like a book that I was browsing, everything had to follow the itinerary according to my sketch.</p>
                            <p>I was contemplating and I was seeing the plan of my creation and I imposed a law so that once everything was animated, they will converge to my will.</p>
                            <p>Everything has to follow the itinerary of my sketch, once I had finished designing the sketch there was colour embellishing the creation, my energy was animating that which was a sketch.</p>
                            
                           <h3>God’s creation is perfect</h3>
                            <p>Son of man, understand that my creation is without fault as many with their erroneous science that they cannot master yet they are accusing me of mistake.
                            The works of my hand are touched by my energy and my creation is energetical.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Jesus, Shadrack, Meshach and Abednego in the fire</h3>
                            <p>This is what the Lord Jesus told the three Hebrew boys in the furnace of fire.</p>
                            <p>“Behold we are in the school of fire, this is where you human beings allows me to make you my work, this is place I make you and I do in you a work”.</p>
                           <p>When we pass through trials and tribulations, we become the work of God.</p>
                            <p>The fire of purification is the is the pass that get you from time to immortality and eternal life.</p>
                            <p>I have appeared to you in the fire in order to testify that I am the author of my Word, which will be proclaimed in the four corners of the earth up to the fourth generation through the four gospels.</p>
                            
                           <h3>The Divine Principle of Eternity</h3>
                           <p>Jesus said, fire is the last phase of transformation and purification that cause my children to look like me.</p>
                           <p>When you are seeking me and my presence in the journey of faith without going through the fire your experience will be temporary and not total.</p>
                            <p>The Lord said, “whoever goes through fire changed his nature and undergo transformation which will not allow him to go back to his previous raw state because the processed cannot be reversed.”</p>
                           <p>Then the Lord said, “whoever goes through the fire of purification gets divine power, that impart to him the divine principle of eternity. This substance of eternity will enable him to dominate death once and for all.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Manifestation of the flame of fire</h3>
                            <p>In the law of Moses, it was said in the beginning was the Word and God said, “let there be light”.</p>
                           <p> I want to underline to you that this was the manifestation of the flame of fire which was moving in emptiness.</p>
                            <p>It was through this moving flame of fire that my voice was uttering words of creation.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Manifestation of the flame of fire</h3>
                           <p>When I was transmitting the 10 commandments to Moses, it was through the same flame of blazing fire that was manifested, and every command that was issuing to Moses was a tongue of fire that was detaching from me and was printed on the table of stones.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Transmitting the fire through the Word</h3>
                            <p>You must understand that My Word is fire and fire is a part of me, and My nature is fire.</p>
                           <p>When I gave my word to Moses through fire, the Word was intended to transmit my fiery nature to my people.</p>
                           <p>That is why I am called the Word of God.</p>
                           <p>Every commandment that I gave Moses is a flame of fire, and the ten commandments are the 10 flames that I gave you in order to make a fiery covenant with you.</p>
                            <p>At Pentecost, I transmitted my fiery nature to the 120 disciples so that they can have my nature of fire.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Burning without being consumed</h3>
                            <p>You must understand that my fire glow but does not consume. Therefore, fear not when I come to set you ablaze and kindle you.</p>
                            <p>Fear not when I come to test you. Fires of trial and test can appear tough but it will not consume you.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, this is the mechanism of transformation to the dimension you are required to reach and to become.</p>
                            <p>Today you must discover why I had to come down and be manifested to Moses in the burning bush in order to give him a commission. This is the answer that you are in need of.</p>
                            
                            <h3>The True Deliverance</h3>
                            <p>The true deliverance is when you go through fire of purification that destroy your fleshy emotion and sharpen your spiritual sensibility.</p>
                           <p>In that stage and level none can capture and overpower you.</p>
                            
                            <p>The fire for the rapture</p>
                            <p>The Lord said the Church is also preparing for a journey because very soon the Church will be raptured.</p>
                            <p>Very soon the Church is travelling to the heavenly Jerusalem.</p>
                            <p>The Lord said to me, if I took you to the time of Daniel it is so that your understanding will be opened in this end time.</p>
                            <p>Because the king who had erected the statue symbolized the devil, who wants to be worshipped, that is why I have sent the pillar of fire because it is late in the night, just like the pillar of fire was leading the children of Israel in the night in the wilderness, My servant Paul wrote that the night is nearly over; the day is almost here, the time is gone and it is night. David said, your word is a lamp unto my feet and light unto my path, and because of the absence of the word which is the light there is darkness in the world.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Preaching the Word removes darkness</h3>
                            <p>Lord has sent the pillar of fire in the night which signify the second exodus.</p>
                            <p>The pillar of fire is deployed in this end time marked by darkness resulting from the absence of the light which is the word.</p>
                           <p> We are in the night where the word is not preached.</p>
                           <p> In this darkness the Lord has sent the pillar of fire which is active in the Church in this time of darkness to lead the children of God out of this world. This is the time of exodus and as the children of Israel were following the pillar in the night, we are to follow the pillar of fire leading us out of this world to the eternal kingdom. We are making preparation and getting ready to leave. We are following the pillar of fire which is the Lord Jesus Christ who is leading this second exodus to the promised land.</p>
                            
                           <h3>The Church to go through fire of purification</h3>
                           <p> The Lord said, the fire and the pillar of fire is the prophecy of the walk of the Church, and the Church is leaving.</p>
                            <p>The Lord said, Babylon is the symbol of this world seduction and in order to pass and overcome this test the Church will have to go through fire of purification.</p>
                           <p> The children will need to be broken. The Lord said, we are in the school of fire where we allow him to work on us. The trails of fire allow the Lord to initiate a work in us so that he can use us after purifying us in fire. Whoever goes through fire allows the Lord to make him something and to work in him,</p>
                            
                            <h3>The Lord’s duty to make us ready for heaven</h3>
                            <p>For the Lord to work through us we have to go through fire.</p>
                            <p>The Lord said, I have the duty of purifying you like gold, from the raw state to the finished state.</p>
                            <p>The Lord explained to me that it is only when we become as pure as gold that we become more qualified and ready for heaven.</p>
                           <p> The work of fire must be initiated in our life and it must produce its result which is purification.</p>
                            <p>When the Lord sends fire in our lives it is for the sake of perfection and perfecting us.</p>
                          <p>  I saw the Lord exclaiming and saying, fire is the final phase of purification process that cause my children to resemble me.</p>
                            
                           <h3> The Easy access route to Heaven</h3>
                            <p>Whoever goes through fire the access to heaven has become easier for him because he resembles the Lord.</p>
                           <h3>Whoever goes through fire become perfect.</h3>
                           <p> The Lord said, when we begin the walk of a believer if the fire of God has not yet broken us, we will likely fall again. But whenever we go through the transformation of fire we will never return to our initial raw state.</p>
                            <p>Any object that goes through transformation as a result of fire never return to its initial state, fire changes the nature.</p>
                            
                            <h3>The reason for backsliding</h3>
                            <p>This implies that any believer of Christian that goes back to his initial sins and transgression has never gone through fire of purification. Every time you see a believer backsliding, this is due to the fact that he has not yet gone through fire.</p>
                           <p>Every time a Christian goes back to his sins and transgression, it is a result of the fact that he has not yet gone through fire. He has not undergone purification of fire, otherwise he would not have gone back to his initial sins and condition.</p>
                            
                            <h3>The Word of God makes us to go through fire</h3>
                            <p> When a material goes through fire it never returns to its initial state.</p>
                           <p>  Every time we receive the word of God, we are receiving fire which has detached itself from God.</p>
                           <p>  The Lord said, in Moses day in the beginning was the word, this was the manifestation of the flame that was moving in emptiness.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Understanding the ways of God- Psalms 105</h3>
                            <p>10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: 11 Saying, unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.13 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he break the whole staff of bread. 17 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. 20 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. 21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: 22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</p>

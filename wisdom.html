                        <p><strong>Lessons</strong>

1. The book is composed of Proverbs. The word Proverb means:

    Truths which are obscurely expressed</br>
    Maxims</br>
    Parables</br>
    Riddles</br>
    Figures of speech</br>
    Enigmas</br>
    Words of the wise.</br>
</br>
It is heavenly wisdom given by the resurrected Saviour as the Prince of peace after defeating Satan (Goliath) as David the despised King of Israel.  The school of wisdom also has its school uniform.  The Author clearly states the uniform one is to wear to enter into this school. This first qualification is called the fear of God. (verse 7).

<strong>What to expect in the school of wisdom</strong></br>

    Verse 2: To know wisdom</br>
    Verse 3: To receive instruction of wisdom</br>
    Verse 4: To give discernment to the youth</br>
    Verse 5: To attain into wise counsels to all</br>

Just imagine verse 7 says as a fool will despise wisdom and instruction.

In science we say wisdom is the right application of knowledge. However, no one can apply knowledge without wisdom and no one can have wisdom without the fear of God. The school of the fear of God is in Psalms 34:11-14. Kindly enroll!</p>
                          <p><strong>The path of the wise</strong></br>

 

Proverbs 2:6 

For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.

 

<strong>Verse analysis</strong></br>

The verse shows three things which come from One source.

The three things:

   1. Wisdom
   2. Knowledge
   3. Understanding

The One source

The LORD</br>

 

<strong>Descriptions</strong></br>

The LORD is one of the Names of God. In Genesis chapter 1, He is the Creator. He is called Elohim. Which means The Mighty one. After Genesis 12 He reveals Himself as El Shaddai to Abraham. El Shaddai means the All sufficient One. Later in Exodus 3 He reveals Himself to Moses as Jehovah or Yehovah or Yahweh. The name means Redeemer. It is in this redemptive name that He gives wisdom in Proverbs 2:7.

This means all truth is found only in understanding how God send His Son to redeem us. Actually, Jesus said He is the Truth (John 14:6).

 
</br
<strong>The three things in the description</strong></br>

To understand the three things, we need to understand the path of life. When one wants something or has a problem he or she thinks hard. Then one comes up with an idea. If this idea works all the time at all places by all people is called truth. An accumulation of truths is called knowledge. If one fears God the he gets the ability to use the knowledge. The application of knowledge is called wisdom. The accurate timing to apply wisdom is called understanding. This is the path of life. Then, the Lord says from His mouth comes truth. John 17:17: says thy word is truth.  In Luke 4:4 it says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes out of the mouth of the LORD. Therefore, the path of life starts with God and ends with God. Is He not the Alpha and Omega? Hallelujah and glory to our Father God.

Let's say a thankful Amen.

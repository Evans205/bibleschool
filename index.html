                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>The Lukenya Bible school of Ministry does not necessarily train students to be pastors, but we aim at equipping BELEIVERS in the Word of God and discipling them to be mature disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ. Remember, once someone believes that Jesus Christ died for his or her sins and that Jesus Christ was buried and rose again the third day, and that believer is baptized in water and filled with the Holy Spirit, Then, they should now study to show themselves approved as workmen and women who rightly divides the word of truth without being ashamed. (2 Timothy 2:15).  This is the main objective of the Lukenya Bible school. We therefore do our uttermost to provide a sound and balanced theological standing from which our graduates may fulfill their God given purposes and callings.</p>

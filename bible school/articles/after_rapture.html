                        <p><strong>What Will Take Place Between Now and Eternity:
                        </br>By Dr. Josphert Kimatu, BSc. MPhil, PGDE, PhD</strong> </br>Below is a summary of the events that are taking place now on earth and in heaven. It is very important that we learn and internalize them seriously. This is because they are absolutely relevant for our status in eternity. The focus is mainly on the Body of Christ. That is, the people who have repented their sins and have believed that Jesus Christ died on the cross for their sins and has been raised to be our righteousness. Visit www.josphert.com for more details on how to be born again.</p></br>
                        <p><strong>A. Today we are having the preparation of the Church</strong></br>

 </br>

    1.The Lord is preparing a place for us before He comes again. (John 14:3, says, I go to prepare a place for you)</br>
    2.Today we are preparing for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are washing ourselves with the Blood of the Lamb of God. To be clothed in white linen, which is His righteousness. (Rev 19:7… says, His wife hath made herself ready)</br>
    3.We are keeping ourselves holy. (Eph 5: 27...says, 27  that it should be holy and without blemish).</br>
    4.We are watching and praying. (Luke 21:36…says. 36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always….)</br>
    5.Today we are waiting for the rapture. (1 Thess 1:10 says, wait for his Son from heaven).
<strong></br>
     B. The Translation and the Rapture</br></br>
</strong>
Then a major event shall take place anytime from now. The Lord Jesus Himself shall descend from heaven. There shall be a shout, and a sound of a trumpet. The born-again people in the Church shall hear the shout of the Lord Jesus. Israel shall hear the trumpet. The rest of the world shall hear nothing. The dead in Christ shall hear the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ and be resurrected. The Church shall be translated and shall be caught up into the air. The sinners who are dead shall remain dead.
</br></br>
 

We are waiting for the Shout of the Lord. Probably the Lord shall shout, “Come up hither” (Rev 4:1)
></br>
    1.Shout of the Lord.</br>
    2.Rising of the sleeping in Christ</br>
    3.Translation of the living in Christ to have new bodies.</br>
    4.Catching into the Church in the air</br>
    5.Meeting of the Church with the Lord in the air</br>

 
<strong>
1 Thessalonians 4: 13-17</br>
</strong></br>
But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. 16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

 <strong></br>

1 Corinthians 15: 51 -55</br>
</strong>
Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</p>
                        <p><strong>C. Immediately after arriving in heaven
</strong></br>
    1.The Church shall go straight to the judgement seat of Christ.
    </br>2.Jesus Christ Himself, shall sit as the judge.
    </br>3.Everybody in the Body of Christ shall stand alone to be judged.
    </br>4.It is called Bema judgement, because it is for receiving rewards for the work each one has done on earth.
    </br>5.Five types of crowns shall be given to the members of the Body of Christ.

</p>
<p><strong>
The judgment seat of Christ
 </br>
2 Corinthians 5: 10 
 </br></strong>
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
 </br><strong>
Romans 14: 10 
 </br></strong>
But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
 </br> </br>
 
<strong>
The Types of Crowns that shall be given at the judgement seat of Christ</strong></p></br><strong>
<p>1.  The Incorruptible Crown</strong>
</br>
Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.25 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.26 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:27 But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. 1 Corinthians 9: 24 -27

 </br></br></strong>

2. The Crown of Rejoicing
</br></strong>
1 Thessalonians  2:1 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain: …Verse 2 we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.
</br></br>
…..

1 Thess 2: 19 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
20 For ye are our glory and joy.
</br></br>
 <strong>

 3. Crown of Life
</strong></br>
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. James 1: 12

 <strong>
</br></br>
Revelation 2: 10
</strong>
 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.

 </br></br>
<strong>
4. Crown of Glory</strong>
</br></br>
The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;3 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. (1 Peter 1: 1-4)

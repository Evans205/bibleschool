                        <p><strong>STRONG  WARNING; Do not wait to look up too late in hell</br>

The facts spoken by Jesus in Luke 16: 19-31:</strong></br> 19 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
</br>
20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,

21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover, the dogs came and licked his sores.
</br>
22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
</br>
23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
</br>
24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
</br>
25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
</br>
26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.
</br>
27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:
</br>
28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
</br>
29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
</br>
30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
</br>
31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</p>
  </br>                      <p><strong>Facts to recognize.</strong></br>

    1.Nobody is too rich or too poor to die.</br>
    2.One day every body will look up to God.</br>
    3.One day every man must cry to God, and say, “Have mercy on me”. Either now or in hell.</br>
    4.God wants you in heaven, satan wants you in hell. It is your choice.</br>
    5.102 people die on earth every minute.</br>
    <strong>Facts in hell;</strong></br>
       </br> 1.It is place of great thirst, where one drop of water is very precious.
       </br> 2.It is a place of torment.
       </br> 3.It is a place of no escape. It is permanent prison.
        </br>4.It is a place with tormenting fire.
       </br> 5.It is a place you shall remember all your sins
        </br>6.It is a place you shall never wish anybody came there.
        </br>7.It is a place you shall remember your sinful relatives.
        </br>8.It is a place you shall remember you were told to avoid going before you died.
        </br>9.It is avoided by those who repent now.
        </br>10.It is a place of eternal painful, hopelessness

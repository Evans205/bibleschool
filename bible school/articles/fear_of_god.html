                        <h3><b>FEAR OF THE LORD</b></h3>

                            <p>The lesson toady is very important in the heart of God. It helps us to keep away from angering God. The anger of the Lord is one of the things which made the saints of God to fear God. God can be angry, especially if one has idols.
                            
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. Proverbs 1:7</p>
                       <h4>Four Types of Fear </h4>

                        <p>The fear of man<br>
                       Demonic fear<br>
                       Natural fear<br>
                      The fear of God</p>
                      <h4>The Fear of Man</h4>

                        <p>1. It makes a man to be trapped by forces which limit his efficiency. It is a very dangerous trap. This kind of fear makes man to look bigger than God.<br>
                        
                        2.  Some people think it is respect but in the real sense it’s the devil’s trap to make man to be a threat towards a fellow man.<br>
                        
                        3. Some people fear men because of the positions they occupy, others fear them because of the size of their bodies, while others fear the number of men or what they may think or say.</p>
                      <h4>Remedy</h4>

                        <p>1.The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe. (Proverbs 29:25)
                        
                        <h4>Don’t Fear Man</h4><br>
                        
                        1.  I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about. (Psalm 3:6)
                        
                        <h4>Don’t Fear Man</h4><br>
                        
                        1. We should not fear what men say about anything. If you know that God has said conclusively about a matter, we should not be moved by the opinions of men by any means. Some fear because they think men shall beat them or hurt them.
                        <br>
                        2. And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. (Ezekiel 2:6)
                        
                         <br>
                        
                        3. Some even imagine that words can break their lives so they curl and shy away in fear. The devil sometimes tries to instill this kind of fear through dreams. We should make up a quality decision that we shall never fear men words or their appearances. Look at them and speak to them, eye ball to eye ball, and declare to them the total counsel of God. Jesus told us not to fear men because they cannot kill the body and then kill the soul in hell. Despite any man’s opposition, don’t fear men or women.
                        
                         4.And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear Him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. (Matthew 10:28)
                        
                        5. And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. (Luke 12:4)</p>
                        <h4>Demonic Fear</h4>

                           <p> 1. The second kind of fear is demonic fear. This is another destructive force which the devil uses to bombard the souls of men. We must get so close to God, and walk with Him so closely until all fears of devils will be banished from our lives and environments completely. We must not fear the devil at all. He is a defeated foe. If we stand in righteousness we will see this defeated foe that is always afraid of us. In Christ, the devil is completely rendered useless and powerless. We have power over the devil, Jesus gave us the power.
                            <br>
                            2. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. (Luke 10:19)<br>
                            
                            3. And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it. (Colossians 2:15)<br>
                            
                            4.  Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; (Hebrews 2:14)</p>
                            <h4>It is Our Decision</h4>

                               <p> 1. We should decide never to fear devils, we have power to cast them out of our lives, out of our villages, out of our cities, out of our countries and out of our world.
                                <br>
                                2. And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; (Mark 16:17)
                                <br>
                                3. Do not give any place to the devil. You give place to the devil if you are afraid of him.  
                                Neither give place to the devil. (Ephesians 4:27)</p>
                                <h4>Natural fear</h4>

                                   <p> Natural fear is a kind of fear which God has put in man so that man can be able to protect life. It is varied among people due to family and environmental upbringings.  Natural fear can be greatly be reduced by our knowledge of God. Our God is so caring to the extent that we should not fear that nature could be also fighting against us. If natural fear is exaggerated, it can become demonic. Examples of natural fears are fear of darkness, insects, thunders etc.  
                                    <br>
                                    1.  And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. (Matthew 14:29-30)
                                    <br>
                                    2.  Ignorance is the main cause of the above mentioned types of fears.  
                                    <br>
                                    3.  My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children. (Hosea 4:6)</p>
                                    <h4>The Fear of GOD</h4>

                                        <p> The fear of God is completely different from all the above fears. It is holy, clean, building and is a God recommended fear for us. The fear of God was manifested in Christ as the most cultivated character. It wonderful to know how Jesus feared God this was a character which made God to be so close to Him. Oh dear brethren, Jesus Christ feared God! Even His prophecies speak of Him being filled with the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of God; and Him being quick in understanding the fear of God (Isaiah 11:1-3). Any kind of being filled with the Spirit of God which does not produce this kind of fear is a fake spirit. The Lord also was very successful in prayer. He had 100% answers to His prayers because of the riches of the fear of God in His character and life.</p>
                                        <h4>What is the Fear of GOD?</h4>

                                             Psalm 34:11-14
                                            
                                            11 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
                                            12 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?
                                            13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
                                            14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.</p><br>
                                             Proverbs 8:13<br>

                                           <p>  The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</p>

                                           Proverb 14:2<br>

                                          <p> He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.</p>
                                          <h4>Jesus Christ feared God!</h4>
                                          <p>  Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; (Hebrews 5:7)<br>

                                             Though he cried and shed many tears. He was heard because he feared God. The fear of God will keep slander out of church, no lies, no late comers, no lack of prayer, no missing of sessions in church, will be experienced after this character is developed. Cornelius was heard because of his fear of God.</p>
                                             <h4>The Fear of GOD in the Early church</h4>
                                             <p> And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee. (Acts 10:22)
                                              <br>
                                                 Peter came and said, “I perceive that God is no respect of persons but in every nation, He who fears God and works righteousness is accepted by Him (Acts 10:34-35).” I mean in every tribe the key to access the heart of God is the character of the fear of God in Christ. </p>
                                                 <h4>Men Who Feared GOD</h4>
                                                 <p>  1.Job 1:1 shows clearly that Job was made prosperous and great because he was a man who feared God and hated sin.<br>

                                                    2. Abraham feared God (Gen. 20:11). His prayer for Sodom shows how he was careful to speak before God.<br>
                                                    
                                                    3. Solomon also knew this in Eccl. 5:1-2. He also said that the whole duty of man is to fear God and keep His commandments (Eccl. 12:13).<br>
                                                    
                                                    4.  David prayed for this character with desperate prayers (Psalm 86:11).<br>
                                                    
                                                    5. Joshua told his fellow citizens to choose not only whom to serve but also who to fear God (Joshua 24:14).<br>
                                                    
                                                    5.  1 Samuel 12:14 is the microphone of Samuel telling us to fear the Lord and serve Him.<br>
                                                    
                                                    6.  Nehemiah says we ought to fear God and walk in the fear of our God (Nehemiah 5:9).<br>
                                                    
                                                    7.  Moses is quite outstanding in the admonition to fear God (Deu. 4:10): if you hear God’s word you will be warned to fear Him.</p>
                                                    <h4>The fear of God after the rapture</h4>

You might not drive your legs to any other place before the demand your Identity. You might not wake up tomorrow before they knock at your door. They are demanding it from all men. Children must have it also. Leaders must have it. Farmers must have it. And above it all the church must have it (Ephesians 5:27). It is the most crucial thing in the entire universe. What is it? If you do not know it, you do not have it. And if you had it, you might have lost it, because it is the most rare and greatly valued thing in all ages.

I said only the enlightened ones know the great values of it, it is the great trademark of heaven. All goods and places and persons in heaven are labeled with it. Even pots and horsed (Zech. 14:20).

                                                            What does the genuine godly Answer say that this valued rare thing is?

                                                            <h4>Holiness, without which no man shall see God. (Hebrews 12:4)</h4>
                                                            <p>Holiness, Holiness, Holiness. This is the demand, which God requires from each of us. It is the only chorus we shall hear in all eternity. It is the same song, which is being sang now in heaven. The word of God says, “And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within; and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty which was, and is and is to come.” (Rev. 4:8). This powerful Angels know the most crucial thing in all universe, they sing it without resting. It should be the song of your heart forever and ever. If you don not see it today, you will definitely cry and wail. I am serious. Isaiah the prophet dared to enter there without such knowledge. He cried desperately, “I am finished, I am undone for eyes have seen the holy one, while my lips are unclean.” What He saw in that place was, Holiness what he heard in that place was Holiness (Isaiah 6:1-6). Oh, my heart burns and is moved for our people have not yet esteemed Holiness, as they should. One thing am sure is they will wail and gnash teeth in that place.
                                                                <br>
                                                                My dear friend, the only person who can at lest make us to reach to the door of holiness is Christ Jesus. Sin must be purged, cleansed, removed by only one substance. That substance is the Blood of Jesus Christ (Hebrews 10:4,9). We can enter into the holiness by the Blood of Christ. Jesus is the door to holiness, He is the way to holiness, and He is the truth of holiness. How is it possible for a wretched sinner to be holy?
                                                                <br>
                                                                By faith! Oh what faith? Study the word of God or listen to the preaching of the word of God, and be meek. Then the Holy Spirit will plant the seed of God’s word in your spirit and open it up into eternal life.
                                                                <br>
                                                                This is the experience of being born again (John 3:3,6). Two major ingredients of eternal life experience are the word of God and the Holy Spirit. After that the Holy Spirit will start to build character of the Lord Jesus inside you. This is externally ordained so that at last you should be conformed to the image of Jesus (Rom. 8:29).

                                                            <h4>Holiness is the character of Jesus Christ expressed in a believer by the Holy Spirit.</h4>
                                                            <p>A believer is one who has been made righteous by repenting, and accepting that Jesus Christ died for our sins, He was buried and God raised Him from the dead and made the resurrected Saviour as our righteousness. The believer is now urged to follow after holiness. This includes putting off the old man and putting on the new man who is created in righteousness and true holiness (Eph. 4:24).

                                                            <h4>What is to be holy?</h4>
                                                            <p>
                                                                Basicaly to be holy means to be set apart for God. To be dedicated to God. or in simple terms, if you say, I belong to Jesus or Jesus is my Lord. Then you become holy immediately. This is easily seen when people offer money to God, the money becomes God;s property and it is now holy. or If you dedicate a house to God it becomes a holy house. You can not just walk there any way you think. When Moses constructed the ark of covenant and then dedicated it to God it became holy. Later, a man called Uzzah touched it and God struck him dead. When God is in even in a place, the place becomes Holy. Moses was told to remove his shoes in a place where God was present for it was holy ground. The Holy Spirit in us makes our bodies holy. Whoever destroys the body which is the temple of the Holy Spirit God shall destroy him or her. When you give your life to Jesus, you must not bring dirty or satanic things in it.
                                                                <br>
                                                                My dear friend, God will never accept anything, which is not holy. Even your every body should be presented to Him, Holy as living sacrifices (Rom. 12:1). This is the most crucial in the book of Isaiah. And He says to all “Be ye holy for I am holy (1Peter 1:16) for without holiness you will not see Me”. You will never see God in your marriage, work or prayers if you are not holy. You must be like God. God should be able to say, “This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased”. He said this about Jesus Christ our Lord. But even demons cried out and called Jesus on Identity “The Holy of God (Mark 1:24)”. That is the heaven label. You can call yourself anything but unless you show the character of God – Holiness, you are not born of God. For every seed shall produce its own kind. The seed, which God plants in us after we are born again, is a holy seed and that seed grows into a life of holiness (Isaiah, 1John 2:9). Seek eagerly to be holy, make it your ambition to live a holy life, continue to be holy, try to stay holy (All these are translations of Hebrew 12:14).
                                                                <br>
                                                                So many men and women do not know God. Seriously they are not holy. Come out of them, and be separated, saith the Lord touch no unclean thing and I will receive you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the Almighty God (II Cor. 6:17:18). Having great blessings for all those who are pure in heart, the men of God have seen the terror of the Lord urges us to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God (Cor. 7:1). Holiness will give you power and cause demons to fear (Mark 6:20). The spirit of God is called the Holy Spirit. Let us wake up now or sleep forever.
                                                                <br>
                                                                The genuine godly Answer has it, that the level of holiness in the world is at dangerous levels and desperate seeker save yourself by tearing your heart in prayer and fasting (with mourning) for the end of all flesh is nigh!

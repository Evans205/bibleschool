</br>
2.Deliverance from a desert place as you follow Jesus
</br>
3.Giving to Jesus and partaking of the communion as He shepherds you to plenty
</br>
[The italized in brackets is the message]</p></br></br>
                        <p>13 When Jesus heard of it [ Jesus also used to hear, bad news, bad reports of death of his friends, here it is the death of His cousin, John who was beheaded by Herod because of John rebuking him for unlawfully taking his brother’s wife. Jesus was grieving of the loss of His cousin], he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof [even when you are grieving, you might be needed to give service], they followed him on foot out of the cities [If you are following Jesus, by any means, you are looking for something; like to be a disciple, to get healing, to get a blessing etc].
</br></br>
14 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick. [The compassion of Jesus moves Him to heal]
</br></br>
15 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.
</br></br>
16 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. [The disciples could have asked, “give them what?”]
</br></br>
17 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. [These is what we have, everything we have]
</br></br>
18  He said, Bring them hither to me. [Give your all your resources to Jesus and He shall bless and multiply them to meet all the needs of the people and beyond their expectation].
</br></br>
19 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass [to RELAX and be not anxious but keep expecting, praying with thanksgiving as the Lord shepherds you to new blessings and dimensions], and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven [ask heaven to provide for the earth], he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples [This is the communion principle- which makes the New Testament Covenant a living REALITY, and God, guarantees His presence, gives strength and life], and the disciples to the multitude [It is for all to partake].
</br></br>
20 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. [imagine EATING, EATING TO FULLNESS, EATING TO HAVE EXCESS to give to others]
</br></br>
21 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children. [For 5 to 5x 1000= 5000 plus all that is associated with them, wives and children].</p>

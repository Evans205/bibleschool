                        </h1>
                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p>The Church of God has been infiltrated, intruded, invaded and attacked by the enemy.  This has made many believers to be confused, discouraged and divided. God has been watching all this! Surprisingly, this is not new. The early Church also was infiltrated by the enemy as shown in Jude 3-4.
                          <br>
                          3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.4 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. (Jude 3-5).
                          <br>
                          God warned the Church at that time and the Church took heed and overcame the enemyâ€™s onslaught. The last days Church is also under attack and the Lord has send us to expose and defeat the enemy once again. We have categorized the various forms and areas of attack and their remedies for easy reference below.  Members of the Body of Christ, arise, fight and win in Jesus Name.

                                     </p>

They stop praising immediately they sense a near breakthrough into the presence of God, hence frustrating the believers.<br>
                                                    6.The make the Church to praise in body and lies rather than in spirit and truth. They make them to do all kinds of body actions and sing things which are doctrinally wrong opening the believers for attack.<br>
                                                    7.The led believers astray by pretending they have a break through and a connection with God, but in the real sense they are targeting the youth to show them that the Church is never real.<br>
                                                    Remedy: The leadership of the Church should use the Bible to correct each of the maladies listed above. Everybody in praise and worship must be righteous, holy and pure and proven beyond question.
                                                </p>

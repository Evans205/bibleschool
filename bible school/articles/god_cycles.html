                        <p> <h4>The God Cycles or The God Cyclic Laws</h4>

                            I have discovered through my walk with God in Christ Jesus that our heavenly Father has set spiritual laws to govern His affairs in running the universe. It you discover these laws and obey them you shall benefit from their operations. The laws are self-sustaining and are cyclic in operation. Even in the natural realm water makes crops to grow and summer to appear by following the hydrologic cycle. One component triggers the need of another component so that it can fulfil it!
                            
                            For example, the law of sin and death operates whether you fear God or not. The law states that, the wages of sin is death in Romans 6L23. If any body sins, the law operates to bring death.
                            
                            Most of the parables where given to illustrate the laws of God. Actually, the Word of God is a Spiritual law. The Lord Jesus spoke something in relation to the operation of the laws when He said about the parable of the sower, He said the sower soweth the seed, and then He said the seed is the word of God. If the seed is sown in good ground it brings fourth fruit. Check this in Mark chapter 4. If the word of God is sown in good receptive hearts it brings forth fruit to God.
                            
                            13 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?
                            14 The sower soweth the word.
                            
                            15 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.
                            
                            16 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
                            
                            17 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. 18 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, 19 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful
                            20 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred. Mark 4L13-20
                            
                             
                            
                            The Lord Jesus also spoke and taught us how the devil uses the same laws, but he distorts them so that they disappoint us and anger God. He also said that when men slept the enemy came and sowed tares and left. In other words, the enemy who is the devil came and used the law of sowing and reaping and planted tares and left. The enemy knew that the tares will bring forth fruit and that by trying to correct his tricks you shall interfere with the laws of God!
                            
                            24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:
                            25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
                            26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
                            27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?
                            28  He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?
                            29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
                            30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. Matthew 13: 24-30
                            
                            <P>Brothers and sisters, let us be very careful to follow the laws of God diligently. This is because a simple sleeping can be very costly mistake. The Word of God has commanded us to be very diligent. When we seek God, we must be diligent. All brethren in any fellowship must be diligent. Laziness is the cause of much spiritual poverty (Proverbs 6:6). The book of Hebrews 11:6 says,  But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
                            
                            God only rewards the diligent seekers. This is His law. He can not break it. Scripture can not be broken.
                            
                            The Apostle Peter discovered the importance of being diligent, and He used it at least three time in three chapters of 2 Peter:
                            
                            A.   Diligence in our stand in Christ.
                            
                            2 Peter 3: 14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.
                            
                            B.   Diligence in building our Character in Christ
                            
                            2 Peter 1: 5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;6 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;7 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
                            
                            C.   Diligence is fulfilling our Call in Christ </P>
                            
                            <br>2 Peter 1: 10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:
                            <br>11 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
                            
                             
                            
                            The Sowing and Reaping Cycle
                            
                            Brethren today and speaking of one of the laws which God has revealed to be concerning its operation. You shall discover how the enemy has also sowed tares in this law. So we must be careful not to carelessly remove the tares for we might destroy the whole teaching in the process.
                            
                            The text is guided by the scripture 2 Corinthians 9: 6-14  below.
                            
                            Brothers and sisters, we must read it diligently before we start to analyze it and understand its operation.
                            
                            <br>6 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
                            
                            <br>7 Every man according as he purposed in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:
                            <br> 9 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever. 10 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)
                            <br>11 Being enriched in everything to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.
                            <br>12 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;
                            
                            <br>13 Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;
                            
                            <br>14 And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.
                            
                            <br>15  Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
                            
                             
                            
                           <p> This law of SOWING AND REAPING is very important for the ministry. It touches life and makes God to operate on earth through the Church. It makes other components of the Church to function. It strengthens our faith and makes us to be in fellowship.The tares of the enemy have been a hindrance in its overall continuance.
                            
                            I have realized that the early Church operated in this law and did not lack. Paul preached and taught about it until brethren were even begging to be allowed to give for the gospel.
                            
                            The other thing to realize is that the laws of God are very simple, and anybody should be able to know and use them easily and see the effects,
                            
                            This is how the law operates:
                            
                            God gives to every believer by His grace two things. Bread and Seed. The bread is for sustainace as recorded in the prayer taught by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 6 as the “give is this day our daily bread”. The seed is the amount to invest and to grow our trust in God. It makes us to walk by faith.
                            We have a choice to eat the bread and also eat the seed! If one eats the seed, then he or she has stopped the operation of the law of sowing and reaping for he or she has not sown anything. So, he or she must wait for God by His grace to give another bread and seed.
                            If the believer decided to sow the seed given, then the law will proceed to the next stage. One can sow or give to several areas: you can sow the seed to the gospel and expect 100-fold return (Mark 10). You can sow to the, poor and expect God the father to reward you (Proverbs 19:17), The poor includes the orphans, widows and strangers. You can also give directly for Jesus sake (Mark 10) and expect hundred-fold return. You can give to strangers, to fatherless, to widows, to orphans. What you give is what you receive, if you give joy, time, energy, wisdom, land, money, food, clothes, compassion, love, respect, etc
                            When you have given, then the beneficiaries will give thanks and prayers for you to God for the blessings they have received. These thanks and prayers will make God to give you more bread and seed to sow again. Then the cycle starts again at a higher level. This is called more abundance grace. If you give to the rich, they will not think it is something worthy of giving thanks or to pray for, so you shall receive nothing in return. The giving
                            The teaching in Mark chapter 10. </p>
                            
                           <br> 28 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.
                            
                           <br>29 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,
                            
                           <br> 30 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
                            
                           <br>31 But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
                            
                            The teaching in Proverbs 19:17
                            
                            <br>17 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again
                            
                            The teaching in James 1:27
                            
                            <br>27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.
                            
                            The figure on the side illustrates the cycle of the law of sowing and receiving or the law of giving and receiving. Remember in the righteousness of the law, tithing was a law to be done so that one could be made righteousness and be blessed. In the righteousness which by faith of in Christ Jesus, this law does not apply, if you apply it The outcome is taken as the giving ten percent from your bread and seed. In the New Testament we can at least give more than ten percent. We are not cursed for not giving ten percent. We just stop or limit the law of giving and receiving as shown of the side diagram.
                            
                             
                            
                             
                            
                            The Law of Need and Prayer
                            
                            The Need and Prayer Cycle
                            
                            This is the law of meeting your needs and being a blessing. Or blessed to be a blessing.The law of cycles is very important as the motivating force is our spiritual growth. Praise God, it is also the one you apply in your personal prayers, fellowship and worship of God to meet your needs and the needs of others This is the illustration.
                            
                            If you have a need, this must trigger you pray to God through Jesus Christ to meet your need.
                            When God answers your prayer, you rejoice, sing, praise , worship and give thanks to God.
                            When God meets your needs, He most of the time blesses you beyond what you can ask of think. The reason is because He wants you to share and bless others with your blessings. You are blessed to be a blessing.
                            If you share your blessings, or if you praise God for your blessings, your thanks giving, your songs, your gratitude shall make God to give you more grace and surprisingly He gives you another need so that you can pray again, so that He can meet it again and the cycle continues!</p>

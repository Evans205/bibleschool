                        <p><strong>Song of Solomon Chapter one 

1. Christ for me.:</strong></br> 1The song of songs, which is Solomon's. (This is the spiritual setting of the Book.  it shows the best of the best. Just like we have King of Kings or Lord of lords. This is the Song of songs. The best song.
</br></br>
  B:  2Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine. [She knows who she wants, but does not mention His Name. This is a beleiver on earth longing for the most intimate love of the resurrection Saviour, Jesus Christ.]
</br></br>
   3Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee. (Intense longings)
</br></br>
   4Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee. (Fervent desires and intimate fellowship)
</br>
   5I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. (Revelation of sinful nature)
</br></br>
   6Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept. (Revelation of fleshy works)
</br></br>
   7Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? (Revelation of the believer’s ultimate need for food and rest)   
</br></br>
K: 8If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents. (The way)
</br></br>
   9I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.  10Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.  11We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver. (Replacing the old man with the new man in Christ)
</br></br>
B:   12While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.  13A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts. (Revelation of the spiritual bounty and inward thankfulness)
</br>
  B:  14My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi. (The revelation to outwardly express Christ) 
</br></br>
 K:  15Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes. (Encouragement and new spiritual achievement).
</br></br>
  B:  16Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green. B:  17The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir. (Brought to abundance by the Lord redemptive work)
  </br></br>
Song of Solomon Chapter Two
 
</br></br>
 B:   1I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. (New self realization- I am naturally supernaturally)
</br></br>
 K:  2As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters (revelation of the new nature and its environment).
</br></br>
B:   3As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. (Revelation of the Lord’s unique position and provision)
</br></br>
B: 4He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.
</br>
 B:   5Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love. (exhausted by the Lord’s love)
</br>
    6His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me. (The support and strength of comfort of the Lord)
</br>
 K:   7I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please. (Maturing the believer from within)</p>
                        <p></br>2. Me for Christ</br>

 </br>8The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. 9My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice. (The revelation and the demonstration of the resurrection power, and the shell of self) 
</br></br>
10My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. 11For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;   12The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; 13The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. (The revelation of the riches of the resurrection life)  
</br></br>
 14O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.
</br></br>
  

   15Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.
</br>
The need to enter the cleft and the convert of the steep places
</br>
14O my dove,( she is no longer as a dove’s eye= an ideal state= one controlled by the Spirit) that art in (within)the clefts (her position in the cross= being in Christ) of the rock ( the Spiritual Rock that was smotten= suffered), in the secret places of the stairs, (these two qualify her to manifest the resurrection life= the life of the Spirit)let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice (from the position of the cross= moulded, fashioned, perfected, the mark or brand of the cross, Gal 5, His cross becomes my cross, His cross crucifies all fleshly life manifestations); for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely (this satisfies the Lord).
</br></br>
 

The possession of resurrection life must be followed by conformity to His death. Phil 3:10 We must know the resurrection power for only the resurrection power ( Jesus said, “ I have power to lay down my life and to pick it up”) can pass through the cross experience and survive. You appear ok…but you are yet to know: the full weight of the cross! The full scope of her consecration; the full meaning of the promises.:
</br>
 Hence she needed to enter the cleft and the convert of the steep places.
</br></br>
For sweet is thy voice….the King’s turn to enjoy her beloved also!..and He shall be glad if she is the cleft and in the steep places.
</br>
The voice: refers to Prayers and Praises.
</br></br>
Sinners----Receive the love of God and Repent-----Receive forgiveness of sins----Receive resurrection life---Receive the bounty of the Lord----Cast off self----Receive constantly resurrection life power----Receive the cross----Manifest forth the resurrection life to the world (bear fruit)---Satisfy the Lord
</br></br>
Steep places: challenge human endurance: a call for a steady crawling ascent. Not the position in Ephesians about being seated with Him in heavenly places. Our actual approach to the seating in heavenly places..ie our actual experience of it.
</br></br>
Deal with all that which issued from old Adam. And all that which is natural.= to be the sweet voice and comely countenance issuing from resurrection life.( this is a daily experience in believers)
</br>
This is the beginning of the manifestation of resurrection life
</br></br>
  K: 15Take us (let us catch= be watchful) the foxes (big and small; big foxes go for the fruit, small foxes go for the tender vine branches; is a command), the little foxes, that spoil the vines(ref 2:13): for our vines have tender grapes ( hence the blossoms were out as these appear after the fruit is formed, vines have the fruit of spiritual life).
</br>
This is the beginning of the manifestation of resurrection life==all is very sweet, but if we are not careful and watchful it can be lost.
</br>
What are the little foxes？: every small appearance of the old life, habit, retrospective look.
</br>
Little foxes hide themselves behind the vines===unnoticed. They damage and produce the conditions of unfruitfulness at the early stages of resurrection life….it a cooperative war. 
</br>
  16My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth [His flock] among the lilies.
</br>
    17Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
</br>
 16My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.
</br>
-She reviews the past.: what a testimony!
</br>
-She knows that He loves her.
</br>
Her testimony is true..but is she obedient to the immediate command of : “come -away”?
</br>
-But she persisted in being the center of attraction but it is the Lord who is supposed to be.
</br>
-He feedeth among the lilies.

 </br></br>

This is His service.
</br></br>
Lilies speak of those people with dedicated and pure hearts towards the Beloved…as in psalms 45….this is where the Lord feeds His people.
</br>
I am His lily …..The Lord feeds me….I am fully satisfied!
</br>
She knows she has failed …to respond…to His love…and He was not satisfied.
</br>
(the Lord goes dissatisfied!)
</br>
Does He come at the appointed time?..alas ..the spiritual light is off! And I know I caused it.
</br></br>
 17Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart ( SHINE, Morning ) upon the mountains of Bether.
</br></br>
She admits there are shadows in her life……she confesses her failure.
</br></br>
She knows her union with Him is theoretical. ….she has known His voice, the call of His cross, the demands for a heavenly overcoming life, the necessity of manifesting resurrection power but she has come short of it.
</br></br>
She was not ready to go but she wanted Him to come to her!...the battle..
</br></br>
She calls..turn my beloved….wait until the shadows flee away
</br></br>
 

1.Meaning: the Lord is not with her..since she has refused His call to leave her enclosed life.
</br>
2. She was insisting on having Him in the wall enclosure…foe her own comfort.
</br></br>
The revelation to know: The Lord wanted her to know the priceless experience of His omnipresence...
</br>
She did not know the depth of the pain of separation..( mountains of Bether)….she was just saying, return to me soon..!!!
</br>
She should : ask for strength to go with Him….a way beyond the mountains of separation.
</br></br>
 

But the Lord was GONE….deprived her the pleasant inner feeling of His presence…in truth the Lord never forsook her….but He produced the feelings of desertion in her…………….this method is employed by the Lord for her spiritual advancement ….
</br>
His presence should not stop at the soulish but must be manifested.
</br>
This was to awaken the beloved to go out with Him into His circumstances..
</br></br>
 
 
</p>
                        <p>Song of Solomon Chapter Three</br></br>

   1By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
</br></br>
  

It is no longer our bed!...it is my bed.
</br>
Night..is in plural…she could not understand…..she thought because she has lost the feeling of His presence she has lost everything….without knowing the intention she start to seek Him …but in the real sense she was seeking back her sweet feelings. Nevertheless she was seeking! 
</br>
She sought Him..in doctrines…in scripture…
</br>
2I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.

  </br></br>

Three times it was said she sought. She realized she could not find Him in her bed.
</br>
Knowing the Lord.
</br>
    </br>First is to know Him on the cross
    </br>To possess Him as an indwelling reality….brings us the chamber and banqueting house sensible feelings and advancing spiritual experiences..
    </br>To be possessed by the Lord and be led without limitation of place, space or time.
</br>
The loved maiden …had her bed not His; it was her place of rest. The Lord was disturbing her rest.
</br>
She was now determined to rise..i will rise now and go about
</br>
This is not the time to rest in relation to the world.....she needs to know the deeper rest found in following the Lord. !
</br>
She goes to the city...heavenly city…realm…heavenly facts...heavenly things and beings.
</br>
attended spiritual gatherings..for means of grace like …confession of sin, repentance, prayer, fasting, fellowships….yet all these failed… I sought him, but I found him not.
</br></br>
 

 At least she.
</br>
    left her bed.
    </br>she valued the fellowship of others.
    </br>moved in God’s way of appointment
    </br>she does not cover her internal needs with external things in pretence.
    </br>now she can walk the streets  of the city to seek Him
</br>
   3The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?
</br>
The watchmen were trusted by God to guard the souls of His people in darkness…like in Heb 13:17
</br>
The watchmen were taught in spiritual subjects.
</br>
She was almost seeking excessively...the problem of patience..
</br>
To meet the Lord is a personal thing….no watchman can take you there at all times...they just point out the way.
</br>
The Lord wanted her to walk in the spiritual solitary way….the discipline of loneliness.

   </br></br>

   4It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.
</br>
I held Him…
</br>
The Lord knew how much testing she could endure at this time…she was not perfect..
</br>
She must be given more tests..
</br>
The Lord still allows those who seek Him to find Him even though their intentions are still very imperfect…like the waters in Eze 47.
</br>
This time she is alert….this time she is watchful…..to keep Him….
</br>
She is yet to know that the true life of faith can not be lived together with the life of feelings…
</br>
Because of the revival she had..the LORD was willing to be found by her…be held by her and even be led by her…
</br>
She can not distinguish what is spiritual and what is soulish….but the Lord does not blame her…
</br>
In to her mothers house..since she is a virgin…..her mother’s house in the system of grace….the chamber of her conception is love of God…she know seeks to hold Him in a true sense of His grace and love. ...in a heart full of praise ….in a song….she leads Him to a secret place.
</br></br>
 

The LORD is in a passive state in relation to her!....a time must elapse at this state and stage!
</br></br>
 

  5I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.
</br>
The Lord charges those in a lesser state of grace not to interfere with the spiritual development of is beloved maiden.
</br>
There is a period of quietness: after the exercise and testing.
</br>
The maiden is on her way to spiritual perfection.
</br>
Our of grace and love the Lord has enabled her to gain knowledge….this experience may take a one event or several events. Repeated failures can be avoided.
</br>
She now dwelt in God’s love and grace which truly has more life and positive activity.
</br></br>
  

3. GROWING LOVE
</br>
 6Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?
</br>
There is progress. Both in life and in manner of living, this is shown three items:
</br>
    1.      Her complete union with Him. 3:6-11
</br>
</br>The words are Spoken by the Holy Spirit though some inhabitants of Jerusalem as they see a procession of mighty men coming…carrying among other things a palanquin or litter.
</br>
One voices a question v6 and the other three answer: in v 7-11
</br>
King Solomon and His loved maiden are riding.
</br>
From the wilderness. Wilderness borders Egypt. Wilderness is a place of wandering. She is together with the Lord step by step leaving the wilderness and entering into the Lord’s rest. She desires to live and express the heavenly life.
</br>
The description of the procession.
</br>
a). Like pillars of smoke.
</br>
Smoke is released from fire. Joel 2:30 ..indicating the power of the Spirit giving her new strength . about to burn. !as the Wind blows. The smoke is like a pillar…strong…grace is strong in her.
</br>
b). perfumed with myrrh
</br>
myrrh speaks of suffering and death of the Lord Jesus. Perfumed! Absorbing so as to release. ….a new expulsive power of new affection. …indwelt by the Spirit so as to release the fragrance of Christ.
</br>
c). Frankincense :
</br>
A sweet fragrant spice...which indicates the Lord Jesus in His risen and exalted triumphant life….in special reference to His intercessory life of prayer as a living High Priest.
</br>
He lived on earth and died …we die in Him then we can live His life on earth. He lived, then died, we “die” then live.
</br>
 d) with powders of the merchant…
</br>
 Matthew 13: 45Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:    46Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
</br>
Shows the loved maiden possessed all that is represented by myrrh, frankincense and also all the riches of the exalted life.
</br>
The Lord is the merchant who enriched her. By selling to her. She bought it with the price of obedience and devotedness that stood every test. In exchange she received he fragrant virtues of His life.
</br></br>
 

Observant speakers speaks of His coming
</br>
7Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel.  8They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.
</br></br>
The first reply…of question in verse 6.
</br></br>
This is the Basis of His Power
</br></br>
The first object in view was not the palanquin …but His bed. His bed was for Him and Hid beloved to rest at night.
</br>
This speaks of triumph over the enemies and entering to His rest. Winning in the presence of His enemies. It is night time on earth. Devils want to challenge His rest on earth.
</br>
60 valiant men are about it. 6x10, 12 x5, …with swords….experts….upon the thigh….men of Israel…..
</br>
Solomon was well prepared for any alarms….well prepared…in a way that it will not disturb His rest.
</br>
The beloved maiden faired….in the dangers ….was simply in Solomon’s state/…..due to perfect union.
</br>
We have angels and faithful ones who prepared to deal with any emergency.
</br>
As the beloved comes from the wilderness; there is need to abide with the Lord. Be assured of the Lord’s Preparedness and protection over His victory.
</br>
   9King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.  10He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.
</br>
Look: This is what He has made and prepared even for the daughters of Jerusalem!
</br>
His movement requirements
</br>
   </br> A chariot of the wood of Lebanon: an ark to travel in: human nature with God.
    </br>pillars of silver : life of a believer due to the work of the cross
    </br>floor of gold; holiness
    </br>covering/seat of purple: kingly authority
    </br>paved with love

</br>The second reply: the mentions the litter. It shows His movement on earth…with the beloved..to fellowship with the beloved.
</br>
The litter was carried by staves….like the Ark of Covenant. …carried on the shoulders of the sons of Kohath.
</br>
This means the movements of the Lord are based on those who are alive with His life…with resurrection power.
</br>
The palanquin was made of cedar of Lebanon…wood in scripture speaks of human nature.  ..like the shittim wood.
</br>
Cedar is the superior wood..and represents the human nature of Christ..its tall, stately…above ordinary men…in moral character.
</br>
The silver pillars: is the grace of redemption…which is prominent as He moves. And subjectively as He saves us from the old nature via the cross.
</br>
The floor of gold…; is the ground of His movement...gold speaks of the divine nature…God’s holy life…it is the ground upon which the Lord Jesus can stand and move..
</br>
The Covering or seat…was of purple…this shows the kingly authority of the Lord Jesus. The government shall be upon His shoulders.
</br>
The midst was paved with love by the daughters of Jerusalem…the total affections are the vehicle for His movements. :
</br>
Total mature affections of the spouse. ….made Him to move.

 </br></br>

  11Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
</br>
The fourth citizen speaks by giving words of praise, exhortation.
</br>
The crown here is a crown of joy; as in 1 Thess 2:19
</br>
The crown was due to the union: his bride was a precious crown.
</br>
“Mother” is the system of grace….or the Lord has gotten from the human race a Body who is His bride ..who satisfies His heart.
</br>
It is at this point that revelation is given that she and the King have entered into the real espousals of marriage. ..giving much joy…crowned with joy.

  </br></br>

    2.      The beauty of the new creation. 4:1-5</br>
</br>
Before He had encouraged her by His praise…eg 1:15
</br>
Now here He declares unreservedly. She also shall never praise Him for selfish motives again.
</br>
He says boldly: with a sevenfold description of the praise. These are the features of those who have come to complete union with Him.
</br>
 1Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
</br>
1. The single spiritual perception.
</br>
 thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks:
</br>
The first feature of those who go to spiritual maturity is the ability to perceive the things of the Spirit.
</br>
Doves eyes: are single, to keep the Lord Jesus in view always.
</br>
The danger; of not having a covering for this ability. And hence they show them off to the world. …..and the world can not understand. ..we should not give holy things to dogs or pigs.
</br>
True perception comes from the Third Person of the Trinity. It is necessary to keep this perception veiled as a beauty for the Lord to enjoy and praise.
</br>
    2.      The readiness of consecration and obedience
</br></br>
thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
</br>
Her hair….this shows special consecration and obedience. As the Nazarites…Numbers 6.</br></br>

This is easily seen. This consecration becomes our strength. The consecration and obedience determines our degree of strength before men. The Separation to be a holy offering is the fountain head of spiritual strength.
</br></br>
Hair is the symbol of covering also in scripture. It is a position of subjection to the Lord Jesus and cover the old creation of fleshly life. So that the image and the likeness of God may be manifest. it is the only way to show the authority of Christ to the world. 
</br></br>
Goat;
</br></br>
Usually white…..usually refer to sin offerings. Grass was plenty on mountGilead ..jer 50; 19 and  Micah..7:14.
</br>
This shows the spouse fully fed and ready to be offered at any time.
</br></br>
3. The ability to appropriate spiritual food
</br></br>
 2Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.
</br>
Teeth indicate the ability to appropriate. The masticate food.
</br>
The Lord has provided enough food for our spiritual well being. The question is whether we have the ability to appropriate His provision and use it. Only mature believers can have strong teeth to chew.
</br>
The flock of sheep suggests that ….sheep graze in obedience in the pasture and take the right food by choosing what is appropriate. We must be sheep…some thing from Christ …which make us to obey and take His provision.
</br>
Wool: in the scriptures indicate carnal life and natural zeal. Priests were forbidden from clothing themselves with garments of wool…but were to use linen.
</br></br>
White linen is the righteousness of Christ imparted by the Holy Spirit as our natural life is removed or paralyzed by the cross.
</br></br>
We should not seek the Lord by our natural abilities, zeal or persistence.
</br></br>
Newly shorn sheep are white and orderly.

 </br></br>

Every one bears twins: a progressive ability to bear….teeth come in sets…
</br>
4. The Expression of our authority in praise
</br>
   3Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.
</br>
The Lord is concerned about our:
</br>
    </br>Spiritual perception
    </br>Dedication
    </br>Our food
   </br> Our expression

 
</br>
Lips indicate: expression. The lips are vehicles for expressing the taste of the food which our teeth are masticating.
</br>
The thread of scarlet shows: redemption as Rahab bound the scarlet thread in her window...Joshua 2: 21
</br>
The thread of scarlet also show authority: Matthew 27: 28,29
</br>
The spouse speaks of...having a cleaned life ….and that her lips are under the authority of the King.
</br>
Maturity makes us to take the right food and then we can be able to speak the right words.
</br>
5. The beauty of fruitfulness
</br>
Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.
</br>
The cheeks indicate beauty. They are parts of the face which clearly display; the emotions of joy, anger, sadness.
</br>
Speak of piece of pomegranate not the whole of it. ….meaning it has been opened and exposed.
</br>
Biblically the pomegranate speaks of: fullness of life…because of its many seeds. …each seed is juicy, sweet and red.
</br>
The believer in Christ is glorious due to the appearance and fruitfulness. ..But all this is hidden from the world. ….within the locks…
</br></br>
 

We display our beauty and inner fruitfulness behind the veil….in the presence of the Lord.
</br>
6. The power of surrendered will
</br>
   4Thy neck is like the tower of David build for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.
</br>
The neck represents the will of man. Not stiff necked. Isaiah 3:16.
</br>
The neck of the spouse represents a will in submission to the will of the Lord.
</br>
Implications;
</br></br>
    thy neck is like a tower…: it is not a hunchback or one that is bent. Luke 13; 11-16…not satan bound to see only the earthly or satisfaction. But was high ...free and straight. …established on solid ground.
    thy neck is like the tower of David….this was built by David….hence not ordinary. It was a tower of defense in times of warfare. …it was a store house for weapons. ….the life of a mature believer has stored inward strength within the will for protection (bucklers and shields)..…the ability to choose the Lord. .
</br></br>
This is the victorious position we have in Christ.
</br>
BECAUSE of the spouse obedience like that of David…and full surrender to the Lord…the believer was steadfast and immovable like a tower to do God’s will and be on alert on her defense with a sufficiency of weapons against the enemy.
</br></br>
7. The purity of conscience
</br></br>
 5Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.
</br></br>
The breast is the seat of emotions. They balance of the two sides of the chest. The most vital essence of pure emotion is our faith and love by which we embrace the LORD. We draw to God using these two. Faith and love are the one and only means to unite with the Lord.
</br></br>
Two young roes….
</br>
A fawn of gazelle or young roe is shy, timid and easily frightened….extremely nimble (quick) .  
</br>
This speak of those tender sacred affections we keep for the Lord…..we need to guard them so that they do not lose their function.
</br>
Love and faith should grow together. Identical in size….not great in faith but small in love or great in love small in faith. Is better small faith small love. Be equal is the essence. They are twins….. See both in Gal 5:6; 1 tim 1:5,14; philemon 5.
</br>
Which feed among the lilies:
</br>
The faith and love grow in an environment suitable for the nature she receive from the Lord. The nurture of holiness, purity and God’s promises which is best for the production of godly spiritual features.
</br>
Lilies speak of purity and holiness which make the conscience free from guilt and guile. When conscience is defied then we lose the ground for faith and love to grow.
</br></br>
 

The maidens deeper search.
</br></br>
 Song 4:6 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
</br></br>
Song 1:2-2-2:7 the movements of the maiden:
</br></br>
Shows immaturity: speaks much of what they have gotten from the Lord, boasting of their fellowship, and how the Lord loves them and answers them. Knows nothing of the third heaven and has not been dwelt by the Lord. She is shallow.
</br></br>
After wilderness experience:
</br></br>
    She has less speaking. For example all the words in Song 3:6-11 speaks of the union with the Lord; are spoken by others. While those in Song 4:1-5 speaks of the resultant of the union; the Lord’s praise; are spoken by the Lord.
    </br>She is more attentive at listening. James 1:..he who listen much is one who talks less.
  </br>  she is more controlled by the Holy Spirit due to the dealings of the cross.
   </br> All her feelings are better regulated..and could now have quietness of the spirit at the praise of the Lord…without those private self exaltation and the elation of those natural energies which produce pride.
   </br> she has more active sense of her own weaknesses and freely admitted that she needed a deeper work of the cross.
</br>
She only said :  6Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
</br>
She knows she is yet to reach the climax of spiritual maturity…she knew she has shadows in the present day and was anticipating for the brighter day.
</br>
A fully mature and perfected believer should be free from shadows and be flooded with the light of the Lord.
</br>
The more perfect one is the more he is conscious of darkness.
</br>
The more mature  one is the more he is conscious of immaturity.
</br>
The more one walks in the light the more he is in need of the cleansing of the Blood of Christ.
</br>
The more he receives the Lord’s praise the more he realizes his immaturity.
</br>
What is the way out to maturity ?
</br>
I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.; she must walk in the way of the cross and continue to claim the resurrected Lord as her life for the future.
</br>
When I began myrrh, and frankincense were the drops of perfume of my life and the brought me all these benefits …but now I must hasten and live in the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense..
</br></br>
Mountains and hills mean ..deeper fellowship in His sufferings and death…endurance of greater afflictions …and renounce my former ways and old man influences and yield my self to Him fully. .

 </br></br>

Full identification with the cross and resurrection will cause a spring of a transcendent overcoming power, a greater degree of spiritual perception, a closer walk between my soul and God and a more complete deliverance from the wilderness world.
</br>
A Call to the Heavenlies. (4:7-15)
</br>
The king speaks v7-8 ( most Bible expositors agree ). Speaks of upward spiritual movement. After the decision to comphrehend the deeps of the cross and resurrection the king says;
</br>
There is a time gap here.
</br></br>
 7Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.
</br></br>
Prior He had said  7Thou art fair (4;1).
</br></br>
This means all the blemishes have been removed by the application of the cross…through the process of discipline to produce the holy heavenly life of the Lord….following holiness...Heb 12. to stand on resurrection ground.

 </br></br>

The Lord delight to view those who have come this far and responded.
</br>
 8Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

 </br></br>

We saw that before the Lord wanted her to do two things ; arise from her circumstances and to go to His circumstances. At that time she arose but she did n ot go to His circumstances of leaping the mountains and skipping the hills.
</br>
The Lord’s demand there fore was suspended. But the Lord never lowers His standards or His purposes for His chosen ones.
</br>
He takes His time to mature us….in the fullness of time…he says
</br>
 8Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon:
</br>
There is an urgency and pressing call.
</br>
Saying…Take a view from lebanon ..from her new phase of experience. The tree (wood) is tall, noble, scented ..this is the believer.
</br>
Stand like a tree: this means in the world but jutted far out of the world into the heavenlies…..being with Him in His exalted position of favour and authority and to look downwards to earthly level.
</br>
This is the believers position. ..mountain top.
</br></br>
 

Mountain top experiences.
</br>
We have more than one mountains to enjoy. There are three peaks in Lebanon. Giving an idea of enlargement.
</br>
    Amana; …means confirmation or truth.  ..we look down from this height based on divine truths and thoughts. .
   </br> Shenir: indicates flexible armour. Refers to the armour given by the Holy Spirit. It focus our attention on possible warfare and need for equipment. The equipment is in the elevated ground where we see the enemy movement below.
   </br> Hermon; indicated destruction. This speaks of the victory at the cross and how Jesus the Son of God was manifested to destroy the devil. The believer is a partaker of this victory due to union with Christ.

 </br></br>

In this places …the enemy presence is very real. Eph 6.
</br></br>
Lion dens and leopards.
</br></br>
Lions: they roar….the enemies work is to frighten and terrify.
</br>
Leopard: speaks of appetite to devour.
</br>
We must know the experiences of Eph chapter 1 and 2 before we can fight in chapter two.</br>

Our mountain top is the height of truth.
</br>
Our mountain top is protective armour.
</br>
Our mountain top is our triumph with Christ over powers of destruction.
</br>
We must see all things from above!
</br>
In spiritual warfare we need a position (to see the enemy character and personality) and a vision (to see the enemy) to be attained.
</br>
What was her response: she moves but does not speak.
</br>
This causes the King to say:
</br>
 9Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Glorious Keys of Fasting

 </br>

What is fasting?:</br></br></strong> Definition:
</br>
Fasting is voluntary abstinence from food for spiritual purposes.
</br>
1. It is not forced by an external person but it is a choice.
</br>
2. One chooses to say no to physical food so that one can feed on spiritual food.
</br>
3. It is triggered by a desire for God which is beyond the natural desires.

 </br></br><strong>

Are there people who fasted?</strong>
</br></br>
Yes…great men and great nations have been known to fast.
</br></br>
    Example: Jesus, Moses, Daniel, Paul, Elijah, David etc were men who knew the power and benefits of fasting.
</br>
Some religions even require the followers to fast so as to strengthen beliefs.
</br>
    Example: Christianity, Buddhism, Islam etc
</br>
 Are there medical benefits for fasting?
</br><strong>
Yes even doctors recommend that fasting is good for the body.
</br></strong>
    1.Fasting makes the body to rest.</br>
    2.Fasting helps the body to remove toxic substances.</br>
    3.Fasting helps the body to burn excess fat.</br>
    4.Fasting sharpens mental abilities</br>
</p></strong>
                        <p><strong>Types of fasting</br></br>

1. Partial fasting</br></br>
</strong>
    In partial fast one can abstain from particular types of foods for some time. It can take a long time. For example. Daniel 10:3 I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
</br></br><strong>
2. Total fasting</br></br>
</strong>
    This means no water no food. It can only be to a maximum of three days. Or else you can damage brain cells due to much dehydration.

After all kinds of fasting one has to take small soft foods and liquids gradually so that the body can adjust again. TOO much instant solid in breaking the fast is dangerous for the body.
</br></br><strong>
Kinds of fasting
</br></strong>
1. Individual fasting:  one fasts alone for personal breakthroughs.
</br>
2. Church fasting: For the church to grow and be established
</br>
3. National fasting: For a whole country to return to God or seek an intervention.
</br>
4. Corporate fasting among several people like a family or factory.
</br></br>
 
<strong>
The Length of fasting</br></br>

Fasting can take duration between 1 day to 40 days. The main categories are;
</br></br></strong>
1. 1 Day: Daniel 6:18 (It only enough for mostly individual spiritual survival only)
</br>
2. 3 days: Esther 4:16, Acts 9:9 (For those who seek deep understanding of the Word)
</br>
3. 7 days: I Samuel 31:13 (For those who want to know the depth of God’s Holiness)
</br>
4. 14 days: Acts 27:33-34 (For those who want the manifestation of spiritual gifts)
</br>
5. 21 days: Daniel 10:3-13 (For those who want more in deep visions)
</br>
6. 40 days: Exodus 24:18, I Kings 19:8, Matthew 4:2 (For established miracle power)
</br></br>
 
<strong>
How did Jesus regard fasting?</br></br>

    </br>Jesus placed fasting at the same level with prayer and giving.
   </br> Matthew 6 :2,6,16-18
</br></br></strong>
2 Therefore when ( He did not say if ) thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, 6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. 16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; 18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</p></br></br><strong>
                        <p>The benefits of fasting</br></br></strong>
<strong>
1. Fasting enables one to Repent completely (Joel 2)…as in Jonah 3
</br></strong>
    12 Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:
   </br> 13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.
   </br> 14 Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God?
</br></br><strong>
2. Fasting makes God to pity His people</br></br>
</strong>
15 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly: 16 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet. 17 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God? 18 Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.
</br></br><strong>
3. Fasting brings prosperity
</br></strong>
19 Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen: 21 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things. 22 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.
</br></br><strong>
4. Fasting brings restoration
</br></strong>
25 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.
26 And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.

 </br></br><strong>

5. Fasting brings the out pouring of the Holy Spirit
</br></strong>
28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: 29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. 30 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
</br></br>
 <strong>

Samuel 1:12 </strong>

And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first. 19 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah. 20 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah. 21 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men. 22 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day. 23 (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.) 24 And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day. 25 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword. 26 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. 27 And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,

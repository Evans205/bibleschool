                        <p><strong>The soon coming days of darkness, earthquake, lightnings and demonic terror on the whole earth</br></strong>.</p>
                        <p>The Church of the living God is supposed to be holy, equipped with the Word of God and the will of God. This is to enable it to go into all the world and proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ. Basically, the gospel is that Christ came to die for the sin of man, provide for the new birth and usher in His Kingdom with the resurrected saints. However, much of this work has not been done but, God had planned a long time ago for a way through which the scriptures were to be fulfilled.</br>

Examination of scriptures show that what was began in the day of Pentecost was not complete and as the last days come into an end, there is an expected great worldwide revival. When this revival comes upon the Church; at the same time a great measure of the punishment of God shall befall the sinners who shall be on the earth. The two simultaneous happenings shall be on one hand a full blessing of the Church on earth but on the other hand the first fruits of Godâ€™s wrath on the sinners in the whole earth.
</br>
 It is surprising that most of the saints and the world are not aware of these last days events as shown the clearly in the scriptures. The following are some scriptures pointing to the events of the last of last days of grace. 

 </br>

 <strong>1.Acts 2: 14-21</strong></br>
</br>14.But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: </br>15.For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.  </br>16.But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; 
</br>
17.And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: </br>18.And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:  </br>19.And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  </br>20. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  </br>21. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
</br><strong>
Summary</strong>
</br>
    1.We can see that the Prophet Joel prophesied concerning the last day events.
</br>    2.This prophecy began to be fulfilled on Pentecost.</br>
    3.Not all of the prophecy of Joel has been fulfilled.</br>
    4.We should expect all to be fulfilled as the last days come to close.</br>
    5.We can see that the prophecy spoke of some signs in the sky and also on earth before the day of the Lord.</br>
    6.In the sky we should see red colours and on earth darkness.
</br>
 

2.    <strong> Revelation 6: 7-12</strong></br>
</br>
7 And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.  8 And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.  9 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: 10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? 11 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.  12 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;</p>
                        <p><strong>Summary</strong></br>

    1.In the last days we shall experience more demonic activity</br>
    2.This demonic activity shall come at the same time before what was prophesied by Joel.</br>
    3.The same prophecy of Joel concerning, cosmic signs and darkness on earth is prophesied again as the sixth seal.
</br></br>
 

3.  <strong>   Matthew 24:29</strong></br>

29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
</br>
 
</br>
<strong>Summary</strong></br>

    1.The Lord Jesus here prophesied that there shall be perilous times in the last days. As Paul also said in 2 Timothy 3:1</br>
    2.There shall be darkness on earth to come</br>
    3.There shall be stars falling from heaven, may be an asteroid to break up in the sky.</br>
    4.There shall be an earth quake.</br></br>

 

4.    <strong> Luke 21: 22-28</strong></br></br>

22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. 23 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.
24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; 26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. 27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.  28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.
</br></br>
 
<strong>
Summary</strong></br></br>

    1.The first part speaks of the prophecy to the tribe of Israel which has already been fulfilled and the times of Gentles to tread on Jerusalem is coming to an end.</br>
    2. God shall show signs in the sky.</br>
    3.Nations shall be in distress. Look around and see nations protesting against their own leaders because of distresses.</br>
    4.The sea is roaring and cyclones are occurring more, even in desert countries.</br>
    5.God is shaking the powers of heaven, and changing the seasons, we can call it climate change, but actually is God in action and the creation suffering from the weight of sins on man.</br>
    6.The Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is drawing near and the Church, which is the Bride must be ready.

 </br></br><strong>

5.     Isaiah 26: 20-21</strong></br></br>

20 Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.
21 For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.

 </br></br>

<strong>Summary</strong>
</br></br>
    1.God is coming on earth to punish the inhabitants of the earth.</br>
    2.The people of God shall still be around when this wrath of God is released.</br>
    3.God advices the people of God to stay indoors at this time.</br>
    4.It means that when we see the signs in the sky and the earthquake we should enter into our houses.</br>
    5.It means God shall protect the houses of the saints so that the scriptures can be fulfilled.</br>
    6.This wrath shall be for a little moment, meaning it is not the eternal judgement.

 </br></br>
<strong>
 6. Isaiah 60:1-3</strong>
</br></br>
    1.Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.</br>
    2.For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.
    </br>3.And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.</br>

 </br>
<strong>
Summary</strong></br></br>

    1.The Lord shall cause the saint to arise and shine.</br>
    2.The Lord shall cause His glory to be upon His saints.</br>
    3.This shall be at the same time the darkness shall be upon the earth.</br>

    5.The nations shall later seek to see the glory of the Lord upon the saints.</br>
    6.There shall be great revival on the whole earth.</br>
</br>
 

7.     <strong>Joel Chapter 2</strong></br></br>

1 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand; 2 A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations. 3 A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them. 4 The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run. 5 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array. 6 Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness. 7 They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march everyone on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks: 8 Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk everyone in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded. 9 They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief. 10 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:
</br></br>
11 And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it? 12 Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: 13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. 14 Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God? 15 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly: 16 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet. 17 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?  18 Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people. 19 Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen: 20 But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things. 21 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things. 22 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength. 23 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. 24 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil. 25 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you. 26 And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed. 27 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed. 28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: 29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. 30 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. 31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come. 32 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.
</br></br>

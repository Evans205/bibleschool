                        <h5><strong>THE GREAT SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST</strong></h5>

<p>The following is a list which shows, the unbearable human humiliations which the Son of God suffered for us as He paid the penalty for our sins.  The holy prophets predicted that Christ should suffer the same. Christ knew about it. It was so much for Him to the extent that He almost gave up the task. But because it was the will of the Father for Him to die for us He said “ Never the less not my will but yours be done”</p>
<br>
<h6><strong>Listen to what the prophets said,</strong></h6><br>

<p>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. I hid not my face from shame and spitting.   (Isaiah 50:6).</p>
<br>
<h6><strong>The A TO Z suffering of Christ</strong></h6>
<p>A. The officers <strong>bound Jesus . </strong></p>

<p>Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus and bound. (John 18:12-14)</p>

 <p>B. Jesus was <strong>left alone</strong></p>

</p>And they all forsook Him and fled. (Mark 14:50).</p>

<p>C.  Jesus <strong>felt the cold of the night</strong></p>

 

<p></p>And when He had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand saying, answerest thou the high priest so? (John 18:22)</p>

<p>D. <strong>Struck Jesus </strong>with the Palm of their Hands</p>

<p>Jesus answerest him …. Why smitest thou me? (John 18:23)</p>

<p>E. They <strong>Falsely Accused </strong>Jesus.</p>

<p>Now the Chief priests, and elders and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus to put Him to death. (Matt 26:59.)

<p>F. They <strong>Spat on the face </strong>of Jesus

<p>G. They <strong>Buffeted </strong> Jesus.

<p>H. They <strong>Smote Jesus</strong> with the palms of their hands.

<p>Then did they spit in his face and buffeted Him, and others smote Him with the palms of their hands .(Matt26:67)

<p>I. They <strong>Covered the face </strong>of Jesus  (blindfolded)

<p>J. They <strong>Mocked Jesus </strong>and asked Him to prophecy to them

<p>And the men that held Jesus mocked Him and smote Him. And when they had blindfolded Him they struck Him on the face and asked him saying prophecy who is it that smote thee? (Luke 22:64)

<p>K. They plotted a<strong> deadly Religious conspiracy</strong> against Jesus.

<p>And straightway in the morning the chief priest held a consultation within the elders and scribes and the whole and bound Jesus and carried Him away and delivered Him to Pilate. (Mark 15:1)

<p>L. Jesus was <strong>acquitted but the people still condemned</strong> Him.

 

<p>Pilate said… I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see thou to it. (Matt 27:15-26).

<p>M.  Jesus was <strong>scourged.</strong>

<p>Then released He Barabbas unto them and when He had scourged Jesus he delivered Him to be crucified. (Matt 27:26)

<p> N. They <strong>Stripped Jesus</strong >and put on Him a scarlet robe.</p>

<p>O. They <strong>Plucked out the beard</strong> of Jesus. (Isaiah 50:6)</p>

<p>P.  <strong>Platted a crown of thorns </strong>and put it upon the head of Jesus.

<p>Q. <strong>They mocked Jesus</strong> by bowing to Him as a fallen King.

<p>R. <strong>They spat </strong>on Jesus

<p>S. They <strong>hit Him with a reed</strong> on His head. 

<p>Then the solders of the governor took Jesus into the common hall and gathered unto Him the whole band of soldiers. And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put upon His head and a reed in His right hand and they bowed the knee before Him saying, Hail King of the Jews. And they  spit upon Him on the head. And after that they mocked Him; they took the robe off from Him and put his own raiment on Him and led Him away to crucify Him. (Matt 27:27-30)</p>

<p>T. They <strong>chastened Jesus </strong>though the law said He was innocent.

<p>I found no cause of death in Him; I will therefore chasten Him and let Him go. Luke 23:22

<p>U. They <strong>Crucified Jesus </strong>roughly on a cross at Calvary Luke 23:33

<p>V. Forced to <strong>Jesus drink bitter drinks.</strong>

<p>And when they had crucified Him they parted His garments casting lots upon them what every man should take. (Matt 16:24)

<p>W. They <strong>exposed Jesus publicly naked</strong> and still parted His garments.

<p>And they that passed by railed on Him wagging their heads and saying, Ah, thou that destroyed the temple and buildest it in three days. (Mark 15:29)

<p>X. The thieves <strong>reviled Jesus </strong>even on the cross.

<p>Let Christ the King of Israel descend now the cross, that we may see and believe, And they that were crucified with Him reviled Him. (Mark 15:32)

<p>Z.  Jesus Christ<strong> was forsaken by God</strong> at the greatest hour of need..

<p>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying, Eloi Eloi, lama sabachthani? Which is being interpreted, my God my God, why hast thou forsaken Me? (Mark 15:34).
    <br>
<h5><strong><u>  The sufferings of Christ did the following for us:</u></strong></h5><br>
<ol>
<li>He <strong>died </strong>so that we can have <strong>eternal life.</strong></li>
<li>He was <strong>stripped </strong>so that we can be healed from <strong>all diseases and sicknesses.</li>
<li>He was <strong>ashamed</strong> so that we can have <strong>honour.</strong></li>
<li>His <strong>crown of thorns</strong> were to break all the <strong>curses</strong> of the fall.</li>
<li>His <strong>hunger and thirst </strong>were to eliminate<strong> poverty and famine</strong></li>
<li>He was <strong>rejected </strong>by God so that we can be <strong>accepted</strong> by God..</li>
<li>He was </strong>unclothed</strong> so that we can be <strong>clothed </strong>by the righteousness of God</li>
</ol>

                    <!-- Article Content -->
                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p>In the universe we have two Kingdoms, which are in constant deadly warfare. The idea of kingdom is still seen in the old testament, whereby prophets like Daniel prophesied and said,

 <strong>“ And in the days of these kings shall the God of Heaven set up a Kingdom which shall never be destroyed, and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break and it shall stand for ever “ (Daniel 2:44).</strong>

But before the everlasting Godly Kingdom becomes the super kingdom, we must now understand the two kingdoms, which are constantly fighting.</p>
                        <p><strong>THE KINGDOM OF LIGHT AND KINGDOM OF DARKNESS</strong><br>
<strong>Colossians 1:13 says that believers have been

 “translated from the kingdom of darkness and translated into the kingdom of His dear Son”.
 </strong>

This kingdom of His dear Son is the Kingdom of light or the kingdom of God. This is the kingdom which God the Father says, we should make it our priority by forgetting and postponing all other duties to SEEK IT FIRST.

<strong>“Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all other things shall be added unto you, Matthew 6:33”.
</strong>

God will always say the first things first. Oh! “Seek ye first”… this means you are already in the kingdom of darkness and if you do nothing you will be lost forever. Dear Sir or madam!.. hear God and live, he says, seek ye… first… His  Kingdom. You will seek it and seek it, until you will see it “within you” (Luke 17:21).

<strong>Luke 17:20-21 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! For, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
</strong> </p>
                        <p><strong>WHERE ARE THE KINGDOMS?
                        </strong>
You might want to know where these kingdoms operate. First the Kingdom of God is fully established in heaven. That is the place from where we pray, “Thy Kingdom come”. Two, here on earth, we have two kingdoms, which are, fully fighting; these are the kingdom of God and the kingdom of devil (Satan). You cannot at any time be in both kingdoms. You are either in light or in darkness. You are either under the majestic Lordship of Jesus Christ or under the deceiving lordship of Satan the enemy of God. Finally, we have only the kingdom of Satan, under the earth i.e. in hell and in death. (These are real places.)
</br>
<strong>GOOD PREACHERS
</strong>
All Christ sends preachers will at all time preach and exhort the kingdom of light. They will preach its principles (Matthew 5, 6, 7). Its expansion (Matthew 10), its power (Matthew 18), etc. for example, look at the Lord Jesus in the book of acts. In Acts 1:3, He said, “things pertaining to the kingdom of God” this was just after His resurrection. Paul said in Acts 14:22, that “through much tribulation shall we enter into the kingdom of God”. He also persuaded the Ephesians concerning the things of the kingdom of God in Acts 19:8, Up to the last chapter of Acts (28), Paul was preaching the Kingdom of God (Acts 28:23). And the preaching should never be changed. All preachers should be clear in telling about the kingdom, which he or she is proclaiming.
</br>
<strong>SOME INDICATION OF GOD’S KINGDOM
</strong>
Rom. 14:17. The kingdom of God is not meat or drink, but righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.
1 Cor 4:20. The kingdom of God is not in word but in power.
1 Cor 15:50 flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. 
2 Peter 1:11 Everlasting kingdom of our salvation and Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Cor. 6:9 The unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God… neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkard, nor revilers, nor extortionist shall inherit the kingdom of God.

Gal. 5 :19-21, Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, sedition, heresies, envying, murders, drunkenness, reveling and such like… that they which do such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God. (You can study and see the kingdom of the devil and its fleshly fashions and also the kingdom of our blessed Lord Jesus Christ and the fruit of the Spirit).
So you see, the kingdom of God is too much in the light that all can see its clear manifestations, the manifestation of the devil is usually began by sexual sins, then drunkenness and later bad words and hate,etc. Don’t be fooled if you see one symptom of the kingdom of Satan trying to cling on you. Don’t try to change yourself.  It is too dangerous. Just follow the steps of entering into the Kingdom of God and you will find an automatic law of life, which will keep you as a true new creature, kept by the power of God and not by trying! Follow the steps carefully even if you will not succeed seven times don’t give up. You are seeking the establishment of God’s Kingdom within you. Be sure not to patch up, but to enter from the first step to the fourth step.
</br>
<strong>ENTERING INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD
</strong>
You can almost all the time be sure of God’s way or principle, for it will be shown in most occasions in three areas. First, in the Old testament (as a shadow), second in the New testament (in Christ), and thirdly in the natural world; All this will be confirmed by the Holy Spirit in our hearts.
For example there are four important steps, which are followed, in a spiritual birth. When we talk of spiritual birth, we also mean to be born again, to be saved or to enter into the kingdom of God. These steps are:
 </br>
<strong>Repentance towards God
Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
Baptism in water in the name of the father, Son and the Holy Spirit and
Receive the Holy Spirit.
</strong>
All these are of great significance and I tell you, you must now tighten your belt for you will get great revelations. There are also four steps in a natural birth of a child which are also related to the above four.
Delivery: This is the coming from a selfish life of the womb to the outside world. This is corresponding to repentance.
Cutting of the umbilical cord: This is to make sure that food now will come by faith. One has to trust God for food’s provision.
Cry of the baby: This enables the baby to breath the new atmosphere, oxygen; significant of the believers ability to breath the heavenly atmosphere as he or she receives the Holy Spirit.
Lastly, the baby is washed to signify the Baptism in much water.
</br>
<strong>THE ORDER
</strong>
The order of the steps might change but the first and the second are usually the only ones, which guarantee the third and the fourth.
</br>
<strong>SOME ROOTING ARGUMENTS
</strong>
I would like to discuss with you some points about the steps above, so that you will not easily be carried about by winds of doctrines. Then I will discuss in detail the four steps above.
</br>
<strong>FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST
</strong>
Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospels (Matt-John) was a physical look on to a Messiah. The Jews expected a physical king (Matthew to John).
Faith in the epistles, (that is, from Romans to revelations), saints looked at the glorified messiah, by the revelation of the Holy Spirit.
</br>
<strong>BAPTISM IN WATER
</strong>
In the gospels, (that is Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) was the baptism of John the Baptist, which was for repentance. It was to show that a person was ready to accept and return back to Jehovah God of Israel, being ready for the Messiah.
Baptism in the epistles was for identification of the saints with the death, burial and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is the actual water baptism required today. Please don’t confuse the two.
</br>
<strong>EXAMINATION OF THE BOOKS OF ACTS
</strong>
The book of Acts appears just after the Gospels, and this is of great significance. The 28 chapters should be read carefully by all the preachers. It clearly shows that when the gospel was preached a response was expected. It is the only book in the Bible which accurately shows how people became Christians, how people entered into the kingdom of God or were born again. Oh! Let me prove it to you further.</br>
<strong>A).THE OLD TESTAMENT
</strong>
The Old Testament shows us that a Messiah shall come. He shall die for our sins and be buried 3 days and on the third day rise again. So if one studies the Old Testament carefully, you will be looking to the future hope of Israel, and the world, that a Savior will come.
</br> 
<strong>B).THE GOSPELS
</strong>
The Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), show the Messiah being born, His ministry, His death, burial and bodily resurrection, His final commission to his disciples and His ascension. This was a glorious fact, which took place. Hence it is past.
</br>
<strong>C) THE BOOK OF ACTS
</strong>
Here distinctly we see the disciples of Jesus Christ going out to preach the gospel to the people. After the Holy Spirit had come, ACTS 2, shows the first sermon of Peter and 3, 000 souls entering into God’s kingdom.
</br>
<strong>D) THE BOOKS CALLED EPISTLES
</strong>
From Romans to Revelations, we see letters written to established saints. Example, Romans 1:7 to all that be in Rome beloved of God, called to be saints.
1Cor. 1:2 unto the church of God, which is at Corinth. Gal. 1:3 “ unto the churches of Galatia”. Eph 1: 1, “ to the saints  which are at Ephesus”. Phil 1:1 “ To all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi”, Col 1;2 “ to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colossae”. Thes.1 :1 “unto the church of Thessalonians” 1 Peter 1:1 “ to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatians, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia. 2 Peter 1:1 “ To them that have obtained like precious faith with us, Jude 1 “ To them that are sanctified by God the Father… rev 2:1 to the church of Ephesus, etc…
Hence the point is clear, the Kingdom of God came only after Jesus rose from the dead and only then could men enter into it. Even Jesus and John the Baptist preached and said “ repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand (near) Matthew 3:2. But we see in the Acts of Apostles, that the preaching was for people to enter into god’s Kingdom and how to stay in it. Paul specifically “expounded” and “testified” about the Kingdom of god from morning till evening. (Acts 28:23).
</br>
<strong>E) SUMMARY OF THE KINGDOM PHASES
</strong> </br>
<table
<th><td>OLD TESTAMENT </td> <td>GOSPELS</td> <td>ACTS</td> <td>EPISTLES</td> <td>RAPTURE</td> <td>MILLENIUM AND EVER</td> </th>
<tr><td>FUTURE HOPE</td> <td>VERY NEAR HOPE</td> <td>ENTERING INTO IT</td> <td>LIVING IN THE KINGDOM BY FAITH</td> <td>TRANSLATION OF THE SAINTS</td> <td>LIVING IN THE KINGDOM IN REALITY</td> </table>


The book of Acts now shows four steps which people (Jews and Greeks) underwent or did before they came out of the Kingdom of darkness and entered into the Kingdom of light, of the Lord Jesus Christ. I will discuss the steps below. God bless you.

</br>
<strong>THE FOUR IMPORTANT STEPS OR THINGS, WHICH ONE SHOULD DO TO BE BORN AGAIN
</strong>
    Repent to God
    Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
    Baptism in water
    Receive the Holy Spirit

The four steps will make one to have his spirit translated, transformed and empowered to live the God-like life.
In the book of Acts, Luke does not mention the four steps all at once, but in every occasion he mentions the most striking point or feature. Amen.
</br>
<strong>THE GODHEAD IN OUR REDEMPTION
</strong>
To “redeem” is to buy one from the kingdom of darkness and permanently possess him or her forever by the Blood. The whole of the Godhead was and is involved in our redemption, this is easily illustrated below.

    Repentance: We always repent towards God the Father (Acts 20:21) prodigal sons return to their father.
    Believe: Believe or faith is towards or in our Lord Jesus Christ (Acts 20:21). Acts states “repentance towards God and Faith towards our Lord Jesus”.
     Baptism in water: This is done in the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. And there is a great reason for that.
    Receive: The Holy Spirit in order to take care of our inheritance possession.
</br>
<strong>JOHN THE BAPTIST
</strong>
I like this man. He knew the Gospel of God properly. In Acts 19:4-6 he fully expected all of the four steps to be accomplished before someone was born again. Just study it and see.
“ Then Paul said, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe in him who should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus, when they herd this, they werebaptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.
The orders of the head of the church, the Lord Jesus Christ are very clear. In Mark 16:16 He said “Go ye unto all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned”.
They already knew about repentance for they had preached it in Mark 6:12. “And they went out, and preached that men should repent”. They also knew of the Holy Spirit for he showed them, that those who believe on him shall speak in new tongues in (Mark 16:17) .
</br>
<strong>THE APOSTLE PAUL’S FORMULA
</strong>
In the book of Hebrews, Paul says in chapter 6 that he did not want to do those 4 steps again to mature Christians. Just examine this scriptures; Hebrews 6:13.
“ Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God, of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment and this we will do, if God permits.
Check again in Hebrew 6:6, if one has to start the process where should one begin “ To renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of God, and put him to open shame”.

See the order.

These are the four great steps to freedom. Can you try to state them again.
</br>
<strong>THE SECRET OF DENOMINATIONS
</strong>
Denominations are groups of a true or false religion, which are only emphasizing one portion of the truth at the expense of the whole truth. I tell you today, that all Christian denominations always try to emphasize one of the four steps of the Great Gospel. I will prove it to you.</br>

    <strong>1.Those who emphasize only repentance-
</strong>
These are the liberals. They stress that one has to do good by stopping doing bad. Hence they speak of salvation by works (good works to cover bad works). You can make a list of such denominations.
</br>

   <strong>2. Those who emphasize only faith-</strong> These are the evangelicals. Their only message is believe and that’s all. You will be “saved”. So will definitely see and hear of other unchristian behaviors in such denominations because, there is no true repentance preached before they believe.
   </br>
    <strong>3.Those which emphasize baptism.
    </strong>

These are also sacramental which only make religious physical things and acts as the only necessary work for salvation, e.g clothing’s, object, rituals.
</br>
    <strong>4.Those which emphasize only the Holy Ghost Baptism.
</strong>
These are the Pentecostals, they say and even demand that we should all speak in tongues to be sure we are saved. They are right, but that’s only a ¼ of the truth.
Brethren, let us wake up and do what God requires of us. Break your bounds of denomination and speak the whole truth. i.e Full Gospel! (As I write this book the Lord has provided me with a very private room and luxury, so that I can write to you without any distraction. So take heed).
</br>
<strong>TWO KEY WORDS: CONVERSION AND REGENERATION
</strong>
For us to enter into the kingdom of God we have to be converted and then regenerated.
To convert
Is something, which a man does. A man must make a U-turn from his ways and turn to God to serve him. God still provides the grace to do so, it is instant but still’s Progressive Regeneration.

Is a process in which God begins work in a man or woman at a small stage but increases slowly to God’s fullness. It then becomes more and more of God.

I can illustrate the two in the diagram below.

In each stage you can see the amount or role of God and the role of man e.g in repentance, it is more of a man than of God. Just as in receiving the Holy Ghost it is more of God, but man still has his part to play. Glory to God. You can actually see why most denominations are either sacramental or evangelicals in the Christian religion. Because they have a bigger role for man! And proud men will want their hearts to be seen by other person.
</br>
<strong>SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT
</strong>
We have two main schools of thought. These are Calvinism and ecumenism. This is how each thinks;
</br>
    <strong>1.Calvinism -</strong>

Thinks, believes and practices that God should do everything for man, in order for man to be saved.
</br>
    <strong>2.Ecumenism-</strong>

Teaches that man does everything in the great plan of salvation.

</br>
<strong>BUT THE BEST THOUGHT
</strong>

The best thought is that salvation is a joint effort of God and us. Although at different rates but in all God and man must co-operate. Can you see now how we will whip the lies of the devil? Let me now speak of the four steps carefully. If you miss them you will eternally be lost in eternal fire! That is now serious it is. If you do not get them please fast and study again them in the word of God or ask somebody whom you know is born again and see their secret. Don’t play around with eternity! </p>

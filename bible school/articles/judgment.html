                        <p><strong>God's judgement:</strong></br> Days comes days go. It seems the days are all the same. Everything continues as it had been in the beginning. Men are born and men are buried, but, there is one day when the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Jesus Christ shall reign, men shall bow before Him and all tongues shall confess that He is Lord. Jesus Christ will be glorified as the King of kings in that day.</br></br>
<strong>
Why Judgment is Imperative</strong></br>
It might be strange but judgment is very important both to God and to men. Sometimes the mention of the word judgment makes all of us to fret. But it always means good to us. There are several things which make judgment important. But, before I discuss about them let me state the following fact. “The first thing which God did concerning man was to create him on the earth. The last thing God will do with man on the earth is to judge him. ” the word of God has several scriptures to verify that.</br></br>
<strong>
The Divine Appointments</strong></br>
It is appointed unto men once to die, but after that the judgment (Hebrew 9:27). The verse simply implies that the Day of Judgment is not far removed from the day of death for all men. Do you know that day of your death? Neither do you say it is far from you.
</br></br>
And the times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men every where to repent: because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that He hath raised Him from the dead (Acts 17:30-31).
</br></br>
Paul wrote that one day, God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel (Romans 2:16). 
If one studies carefully the teaching of Our Lord Jesus Christ, one will realize that the Lord Jesus Christ lived and preached all times in reference to the judgment day. Study the gospels and you will be astonished.

</p></br></br>
                        <p><strong>The Judgment Day</strong></br>
In the judgment day, God shall reign supreme. This makes that day very important. Today men can still boast and do anything because judgment of evil is nor executed immediately, but little do they know that God shall bring all works to judgment (Eccl. 11:9, 12:14). There is a day when all knees shall bow and declare that “God is right and am wrong”.</br></br>
Judgment is also important because it will stop sin. Any sin, which is not dealt by judgment, can be reported, but all sins which pass under the fiery judgment are stopped, for example in raising up children God admonishes us to judge and punish (correct) our children, even with beatings. Any children who have received stripes of correction will stop sinning either in school or at home.</br></br>
Don’t spare the rod. At Calvary, we obtained our redemption and sins were forgiven by Christ being judged. The wages of sin is death. That is God’s verdict. But after we are redeemed we still sin again! This kind of sinning and striping against sin will cease after judgment day. No sin will pass across the judgment seat. At that seat all arguments will be stopped. My dear friend, be meek, just allow the other check to be smitten for the day of the Lord cometh.</p></br></br>
                        <p><strong>The Judgment of Believers</strong></br></br>
All believers must pass through three major judgments. I have listed them below:
1).Judgment as a sinner</br>
This is past. It has already taken place at Calvary on the cross. God judged Jesus on our behalf! He died for us. This graphically illustrated in Isaiah 53. Any believer who has seen Christ at the cross will stop sinning forever. Christ suffered more than any creature in the entire universe. This is what judgment will mean for all sinners who stubbornly want to sense what Christ underwent! To refuse Christ is to desire to be crucified and to cry “My God my God why hast thou forsaken me”. Christ suffered spiritually by being disconnected from God, the fountain of life (Ps. 36:9). He suffered physically more than I can describe now. Even a man plucked off his beards (Isaiah 50:6). To sin is to take Christ back to the cross.</br> 
2). At present we are to judge our selves at the Lord’s Table. Tis is because we are sons of God.</br>
3). In the future we shall be judged at the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in His body, according to that He hath done, whether it be good or bad. This is to reward believers
These three will be discussed later in this website.

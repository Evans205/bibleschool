                        <p><strong>interpreting the typology in the Book of Esther</strong> Esther 7: 6 And Esther said, the adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.

 

    1.God the Father is the King
    2.God the Son is Mordecai
    3.The Spirit led Church is the Queen Esther.
    4.Haman is satan.
    5.The Jews represent the scattered members of the Church.

 

The devil hates Mordecai, being on earth. He hates Jesus.

Esther was hopeless without Mordecai. Mordecai picks Esther and raises her to the Throne, where the Church is seated on the right hand of God. The Church is supposed to serve on earth. Its good deeds must be seen by all men so that they glorify their Father in heaven. The resurrection Church, which is reigning with Christ as Queen and not just Esther. Is supposed to pray for the Church on earth for the sake of Jesus.</br>

What causes this prayer to be effective and the enemy to be defeated is the participation of the whole Church in prayer and fasting.  

The book prophecies that satan actually crucified himself at the cross. The gallows Haman made were used to crucify himself.</p>
</br>
                        <p><strong>What fasting does for you</strong> </br>

      <strong >1.Fasting arranges circumstances for you</strong></br>

Look at verse one of Esther chapter 4: 1 Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.</br>

You see Esther did her part, by making her self smart. Knowing the background of fasting and prayer was now three days. She knew she is standing well in God. Remember believers are to stand on resurrection ground of the THIRD DAY. Believers are to put on the new man. Believers are to come into the throne room. When we do our part, then God makes all things to work for good for us. The environment shall be organized by God.</br>
</br>
2.       <strong >2.Fasting makes favour available to you</strong></br>

Verse 2 says And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.</br>

 This Kind saw Esther; This Esther has been fasting for three days without food and water. This Esther is standing on the prayers and crying and fasting of many other people. She is ready to lay her life for others to live. Favour is given to a person like this. Not selfish at all. The Lord Jesus said there is no greater love for one to lay down his or her life for others. Favour means grace, favour means getting what you do not deserve.</br>
</br>
 <strong>3.Fasting opens great opportunities and doors for you</strong></br>

 

In verse 3 The word of God says, Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.

This is very remarkable. Imagine, is the King who asks Esther what she wants before Esther says what she wants. Fasting is a prayer for you. Fasting prays for you even before you open your mouth. Fasting is the key which opens the door called, “exceedingly above all that you can ask or imagine”.</br>

Esther is being given over 66 Provinces for her to own. These where provinces which lay between India and Ethiopia. Remember Esther was the orphan girl. Who had no mother and father, she grew with only an uncle called Mordecai. She just followed the path of obedience to authorities and now she is in charge of even the uncle. The uncle’s life is in her hands. Brother and sisters do not despise these little ones. It is the Fathers pleasure to give them the Kingdom. An obedient child has the potential of becoming great.</br>
</br>
 <strong>4.Fasting exposes your enemies to be defeated</strong></br>

In verse 4 the word of God says, And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.

The King never new that what He loved most was endangered by some thing very close to him. Fasting was to isolate the enemy. The enemy shall be exposed and shall never know the traps.</br>
</br>
<strong> 5.Fasting makes your enemies to work for you and against themselves.</strong></br>

 

In verse 5 The word of God says, Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.

Fasting will make things to make the enemy to run about doing you service. If you serve the LORD. Then relax for you shall be honoured by the mighty.
</br>
</br>
 <strong>6.Fasting prepares a table before you in the presence of your enemies</strong></br>

In verse 6 The word of God says, And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.

The Lord made Esther to dine and be honored with great blessings when the enemy was watching. The enemy wanted her dead, but she was being promoted in front of his eyes.
<br>
<strong>7.Fasting gives you wisdom and understanding to know what and when to say.</strong></br>
</br>
Verse 7 says, Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;

8 If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.

Fasting gives you patient, makes to be wise. Makes you to be very prudent.</br>
</br>
 <strong>8.Fasting makes kings to visit you for your promotion</strong></br>

 

The Bible says in verse 8., let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them. At the start it was Esther desiring to see the King, now it is the king coming to see Esther.

It is now the realm of, these blessings shall follow and overtake you.</br>
</br>
 <strong>9.Fasting makes the enemy to plan for his downfall.</strong></br>

14 Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.
</br>
</br>
 <strong>10.Fasting makes your good deeds to be remembered and honoured</strong></br>
 

Esther chapter 6 1 says, On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.

2 And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.

3 And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.</p>
